A History of TypeScript Slogans
===============================

1. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.[^1]
2. TypeScript is JavaScript that scales.[^2]
3. TypeScript is just JavaScript with types.[^3]
4. TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.[^4]
5. TypeScript is JavaScript with types, unsound.[^5]

[^1]: TypeScript wants to attract CoffeeScript and Dart developers.
[^2]: TypeScript wants to attract developers on large or hope to be large projects.
[^3]: TypeScript wants to attract all JavaScript developers.
[^4]: TypeScript wants to attract all JavaScript developers, including those who have no idea what typing means and thought it is just a syntax thing. 
[^5]: I just could help myself from listing this *fake* slogan occurred to my mind.
