# Programming Learning Path

## Path One

First, learn English to the level of A2 or B1.
After that, through extensive reading of English materials, computing-related vocabulary will naturally accumulate.
No need to deliberately memorize them in advance.

Sharpening the axe doesn't delay chopping wood.
However, if you feel your enthusiasm for learning programming is being worn away during the "sharpening" process,
you can set learning English aside for now and go directly to learn programming.
Path is not as important as motivation and interest.

Next, read an introductory book.

Which one to choose?
At this stage you basically know nothing about programming, so how do you judge whether a book is good or bad?

Look at the thickness of the book.

This superficial judgment method is surprisingly useful.
If an introductory book is not thin enough:

1. Either the book introduces too many details - introductory books should introduce the essence of the field, to prevent beginners from getting lost in details;
2. Or the book includes content that's too advanced for an introductory book;
3. Or the book treats readers as idiots, doesn't trust readers' abilities - many books give you screenshots for every step, making the book look very thick but actually saying nothing substantial;
4. Or the author just randomly cobbled together a book without knowing what they're doing.

I recommend The Little Schemer.
If this book is hard to find, or if you feel it doesn't suit your taste, you can pick up another introductory book.
Just remember to pick up a thin one.

## Path Two

Don't learn English, directly read the translation of The Little Schemer.
If no good translation in your native language is available, you can use ChatGPT.
Or another introductory book in your native language.

## Path Three

Create your own path.

You often understand yourself better than others do, so the path you create for yourself might be more suitable than paths recommended by others.
Don't be afraid to explore.
As long as you maintain motivation and interest, you'll always find a way through - at worst you'll take some detours.
Even if taking detours slows your progress a bit, being able to blaze your own unique trail will give you confidence.
The experience of independently exploring in darkness will also give you some intuitions which may help you in the future.

Few people have the fortune or misfortune to follow others' paths forever.
Someday you may go to a place where no one has explored before.
At that time, the confidence and intuitions from your own experience will become your aid.
