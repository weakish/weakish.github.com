# Wiki Link Fix - Test Results

This document shows the test results for the wiki link resolution fix.

## Before Fix
Wiki links were incorrectly resolved:
- `[[1a]]` → `/1a/` (BROKEN - should be `/zk/1a/`)
- `[[Sascha2020]]` → `/Sascha2020/` (BROKEN - should be `/zk/Register/Sascha2020/`)

## After Fix  
Wiki links are correctly resolved:
- `[[1a]]` → `/zk/1a/` ✅
- `[[Sascha2020]]` → `/zk/Register/Sascha2020/` ✅
- `[[0b1a]]` → `/zk/0b1a/` ✅
- `[[nonexistent]]` → `/nonexistent/` (fallback) ✅

## Test Cases
The custom plugin correctly handles:
1. Single links: `This has a link to [[1a]].`
2. Multiple links: `Multiple links: [[0b1a]] and [[1b]] and [[nonexistent]].`
3. Links at beginning: `[[1a]] at the beginning.` 
4. Links at end: `At the end [[Sascha2020]]`
5. Consecutive links: `[[1a]] [[1b]] [[0b1a]] consecutive links`
6. No links: `No links here.` (unchanged)

## Implementation
- Created custom `customWikiLinks()` remark plugin
- Searches in `["zk", "zk/Register"]` directories for files
- Uses Deno's `statSync()` for file existence checks
- Replaces `remark-obsidian` plugin with custom implementation
- Maintains backward compatibility with fallback behavior
