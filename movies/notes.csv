266042,A socalled BL movies with Drama overflow.
266041,"The first half hour is already a complete movie. The performance and cinematography are still good for the rest part, but the storyline feels not as necessary as the first half hour. Also the performance of Terrance Lau and Cecilia Choi is unbalanced. Choi is excellent, but her emotional tension is weaker compared to Lau."
