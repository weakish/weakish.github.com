266046,"Brilliantly revals the emotional connection between riots in 1967 and 2019. Compared to Revolution of Our Times directed by a Christian, Blue Island clings to a more depressingly recurring view."
266041,"The first half hour is already a complete movie. The performance and cinematography are still good for the rest part, but the storyline feels not as necessary as the first half hour. Also the performance of Terrance Lau and Cecilia Choi is unbalanced. Choi is excellent, but her emotional tension is weaker compared to Lau."
266043,"Entirely shot on film, revealing the beauty of Shanghai."
266128,"""Sold to Hong Kong"" appeared again in this episode (15:00 – 16:00) and is censored again."
266127,"Cinematography of these old TV series attracts me. For example, outdoor scenes at night are so charmingly dark."
266126,"""People who are married, yet continue to deceive innocent girls ... (girls) could have all been sold to Hong Kong.""(22:00 – 23:00) censored on Amazon Prime Video and was censored on the version dubbed in Cantonese on TVB in Hong Kong."
