V uses warmer, brighter color grading than Y.

At the opening, after the close-up of Olivia’s arm, Y shows the waterfall only in the corner of the frame. V adds a front-facing shot of Olivia wearing a mask behind the waterfall, which makes it clearer that she stops to look at it, but slightly reduces the sense of mystery.

After Olivia exits the cave, V adds close-ups of Olivia’s black shoes and Jack’s white shoes (they do not recognize each other at this point), implying that the places Jack and Olivia choose to visit before going to prison overlap. It also adds a shot of Olivia’s reflection in the water, leaving a stronger impression so that when they meet again later, viewers can recall they had already crossed paths.

In Y, after Jack’s phone call with his mother and before he arrives at his alma mater (St Joseph’s College), there is an added scene of Jack walking out of Hong Kong Park, likewise implying an overlap. This assumes viewers recognize that the opening is shot in Hong Kong Park. Also, if viewers know St Joseph’s College is next to the park, the transition makes more sense.

When Jack arrives at his alma mater, the guard asks his purpose and requests ID and LeaveHomeSafe (a mobile app used in Hong Kong for COVID-19 contact tracing and venue check-in). In Y, there is a shot of the guard watching Jack warily; in V there is no frontal shot of the guard, and removing the facial expression reduces the tension. V then adds a scene where another staff member, Mr. Fai (輝叔), recognizes Jack, pulls down his mask, and chats casually, further softening the relationship between Jack and the school. In the small talk, Mr. Fai asks about Jack’s situation; after a brief pause, Jack says he’s emigrating to the UK, and Mr. Fai says he’s moving to Vancouver to reunite with his children. This matches Jack later telling Mr. Wong (黃 Sir) that he will go to Vancouver, highlighting that both the UK and Vancouver are cover stories because he doesn’t want to tell others he’s about to be imprisoned.

After the alma mater scenes, Y uses the Old Supreme Court Building as a transition—symbolic and, for viewers familiar with Hong Kong, also a location hint. V removes this transition, likely to avoid repetition, because the Old Supreme Court Building appears again later as a transition between Jack walking on the street and Olivia walking on the street.

In Y, after Olivia’s walking-on-the-street scene, a Hong Kong nightscape is used as a transition before Jack sees Olivia; V removes the nightscape, trims Olivia’s walking, and drops the masked close-up of her face, likely because V already showed her face in the opening.

Between Jack recalling Olivia shouting “run” during the 2019 protests and the scene of Olivia sitting in a café, V inserts a brief shot of Olivia walking on the street, implying Jack followed her to the café.

In the conversation where Olivia says someone asked whether she was afraid to go to Vancouver alone, Y ends with Jack saying it wouldn’t be bad to go to Vancouver to have a “jai” (仔, which can mean a child in general or specifically a boy). Olivia says this place really isn’t suitable for having a jai (child/boy), and Jack jokes, “then have a girl” (the English word “child” is gender-neutral, so the subtitle adapts the joke to “then have two children”). The joke lightens the mood, followed by a cheerful sequence of the two running and jumping in the streets. They stop in front of a chain-link fence and look at each other in silence; after descending the footbridge, they see across the street the slogan “25 Years Since the Handover, Hong Kong Creates the Future.” Jack then sees the red minibus next to the slogan and sighs, “Over there in Vancouver, there are no red minibuses to ride,” to which Olivia pauses and replies, “Yes.” In V, they run and jump after leaving the café, then talk in front of the chain-link fence, and the conversation ends with Olivia saying it’s not suitable to have a child, cutting Jack’s joke. After the conversation, they see the slogan across the street and start the red-minibus conversation. Moving the conversation to the fence more strongly implies Olivia is actually talking about someone asked her whether she’s afraid of going to jail. Removing the silent eye contact at the fence reduces the heaviness.

At the end of Y, they board the minibus to report to the police station and walk along the aisle between seats. V adds shots of them seated and the bus in motion, ending on the roadside lights and the Old Supreme Court Building lit up as the bus passes, suggesting they are ultimately heading toward a bright future of judicial justice.

Overall, V is more polished, warmer, and softer than Y.
