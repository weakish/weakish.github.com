調色上，Y 更黯，V 略暖亮。
Color grading: Y is darker, and V is slightly warmer and brighter.

開場，Olivia 手臂特寫鏡頭後只是在畫面角落展示了瀑布，而 V 則追加了戴口罩的 Olivia 在瀑布後的正面鏡頭，更清晰地傳達是停下來看瀑布，但神秘感略減。
At the opening, after the close-up of Olivia’s arm, Y only shows the waterfall in the corner of the frame, whereas V adds a front-facing shot of a masked Olivia behind the waterfall, which more clearly conveys that she stops to look at the waterfall, but slightly reduces the sense of mystery.

V 在 Olivia 出洞口後加了 Olivia 的黑鞋特寫和 Jack 的白鞋特寫，但兩者此時並未相認，暗示 Jack 和 Olivia 在入獄前選擇最後去看的地方有重合。又加了 Olivia 面部的水中倒影，給觀眾更深的印象，以在之後兩人再次相遇時回憶起兩人早已相遇過。
After Olivia exits the cave mouth, V adds close-ups of Olivia’s black shoes and Jack’s white shoes, but the two do not recognize each other at this moment, implying that the places Jack and Olivia chose to visit one last time before going to prison overlap. It also adds a water reflection of Olivia’s face, leaving a deeper impression so that when they meet again later, viewers recall that they had already crossed paths.

Y 在 Jack 和母親通電話後多了一個 Jack 從香港公園走出的場景，通過這種方式暗示 Jack 和 Olivia 在入獄前選擇最後去看的地方有重合。這樣處理假定觀眾認得開場拍的是香港公園，同時也知道聖若瑟書院在香港公園旁。
In Y, after Jack’s phone call with his mother there is an added scene of Jack walking out of Hong Kong Park, which likewise implies that the places Jack and Olivia chose to visit one last time before going to prison overlap. This approach assumes viewers recognize that the opening is shot in Hong Kong Park and also know that St Joseph’s College is next to the park.

Jack 返母校時門衛問 Jack 來做什麼及要求出示證件和「安心出行」的場景，Y  有門衛警惕地盯看 Jack 的鏡頭，V 則沒有門衛的正面鏡頭，去掉了表情後減弱了兩人之間的緊張感。之後 V 更加了另一個員工（輝叔）認出 Jack 並扯下口罩閒話家常的場景， Jack 和學校之間的關係更顯緩和。閒聊中，輝叔問起 Jack 近況，Jack 說要移民英國，而輝叔則說要移民溫哥華，和子女團聚。這對應了之後 Jack 和黃 Sir 聊天時說要去溫哥華，凸顯英國、溫哥華都是 Jack 隨口敷衍別人，因為不想告訴別人自己即將入獄。  
When Jack returns to his alma mater, there is a scene where the guard asks what Jack is there for and requests ID and “LeaveHomeSafe.” In Y, there is a shot of the guard watching Jack warily; in V there is no frontal shot of the guard, and removing the expression reduces the tension between them. V then adds a scene where another staff member (Uncle Fai) recognizes Jack, pulls down his mask, and chats casually, further softening the relationship between Jack and the school. In the small talk, Uncle Fai asks about Jack’s situation; Jack says he’s emigrating to the UK, and Uncle Fai says he’s moving to Vancouver to reunite with his children. This matches Jack later telling Officer Wong that he will go to Vancouver, highlighting that both the UK and Vancouver are just offhand brush-offs because he doesn’t want to tell others he’s about to be imprisoned.  

Y 母校場景後使用香港舊立法會大樓作為轉場過渡，既有象徵意義，對於熟悉香港的觀眾而言又暗示了 Jack 的位置。V 版刪去了這一轉場過渡，可能因為要避免重複，因為之後 Jack 在街頭行走場景與 Oliva 在街頭行走場景之間又使用了舊立法會大樓作為轉場。
After the alma mater scene in Y, the Old Legislative Council Building is used as a transition, which is symbolic and, for viewers familiar with Hong Kong, also hints at Jack’s location. The V version removes this transition, perhaps to avoid repetition, because the Old Legislative Council Building is later used again as a transition between Jack walking on the street and Olivia walking on the street.

Y Oliva 在街頭行走的場景之後使用香港夜景作為轉場，再接 Jack 看到 Oliva，而 V 刪去了香港夜景轉場，並縮減了 Oliva 在街頭行走的場景及刪去了 Oliva 戴著口罩的面部特寫（因 V 開場已呈現 Oliva 的面部）。
In Y, after Olivia’s walking-on-the-street scene, a Hong Kong nightscape is used as a transition before cutting to Jack seeing Olivia; V deletes the nightscape transition, trims Olivia’s walking scene, and removes the masked close-up of Olivia’s face (since V already presented her face at the opening).

在 Jack 回憶 Oliva 很久之前喊快走後到 Oliva 在咖啡店喝飲料之間，V 補了一小段 Oliva 在街頭行走的場景，暗示 Jack 尾隨 Oliva 到了咖啡館。
Between Jack recalling Olivia shouting “hurry up” long ago and Olivia drinking at the cafe, V inserts a short additional bit of Olivia walking on the street, implying Jack followed her to the cafe.

Y 中 Oliva 和 Jack.說有人問她一個人去溫哥華怕不怕的對話，Y 結尾 Jack 說你去溫哥華生仔也不錯，Oliva 說這裡真不適宜生仔，Jack 講笑說那就生女（由於「仔」即可以泛指小孩，也可以特指男小孩，而英文 child 與性別無關，因此英文字幕把這個笑話改成了那就生兩個小孩）。 通過這個笑話沖淡了之前談話的沈重氣氛，後面接上兩人在街頭跑跳的歡快場景，最後兩人在鐵絲圍欄前停下，相視無言，接著下天橋後又看到街對面「回歸25載，香港創未來」標語。然後 Jack 看到標語旁的紅色小巴，又感慨「到了溫哥華那邊，都沒紅小巴搭了」，Olivia 愣了下纔回「都係」。V 則改為兩人出咖啡館後在街頭跑跳，之後在鐵絲圍欄前對話，對話直接以 Oliva 說不適宜生仔收尾，刪去 Jack 的講笑。對話完畢看到街對面「回歸25載，香港創未來」標語，又開啟關於紅小巴的對話。V 將對話背景換到鐵絲圍欄前，更強烈暗示 Oliva 和 Jack 談的其實是別人問她要坐監怕不怕，刪去兩人在鐵絲圍欄前相視無言的場景則降低了沈重感。
In Y, there is a conversation where Olivia tells Jack that someone asked whether she was afraid to go to Vancouver alone; Y ends with Jack saying it wouldn’t be bad for you to go to Vancouver to have a “jai” (child), Olivia saying this place really isn’t suitable for having children, and Jack joking, “then have a girl” (since “jai” can mean a child in general or specifically a boy, while the English “child” is gender-neutral, the English subtitles change the joke to “then have two children”). This joke lightens the heavy mood of the previous conversation, followed by a cheerful sequence of the two running and jumping in the streets. They finally stop in front of a chain-link fence and look at each other in silence; after descending the footbridge they see across the street the slogan “25 Years Since the Handover, Hong Kong Creates the Future.” Jack then sees the red minibus next to the slogan and sighs, “Over there in Vancouver, there are no red minibuses to ride,” to which Olivia pauses and then replies, “Yes.” In V, the two run and jump in the street after leaving the cafe, then talk in front of the chain-link fence, and the conversation ends directly with Olivia saying it’s not suitable to have children, cutting Jack’s joke. After the conversation, they see the “25 Years Since the Handover, Hong Kong Creates the Future” slogan across the street and start a conversation about red minibuses. V moves the conversation to in front of the chain-link fence, more strongly implying that what Olivia and Jack are actually talking about is someone asking whether she’s afraid of going to jail; removing the silent eye contact at the fence reduces the heaviness.

Y 結尾與兩人同登上去警署報到的小巴，在座椅過道間行走。V 在其後增加了兩人就坐及巴士行駛的場景，結尾於巴士行駛時路邊的燈光和亮燈的舊立法會大樓，暗示兩人終將駛向司法公義的未來。
At the end of Y, the two board the minibus to report to the police station and walk along the aisle between the seats. In V, additional shots show them seated and the bus in motion, ending on the roadside lights and the Old Legislative Council Building lit up as the bus drives past, suggesting the two are ultimately heading toward a future of judicial justice.

總體而言 V 較 Y 緊湊而偏暖，一些訊息也以更清晰的方式傳遞給觀眾。
Overall, V is more compact and somewhat warmer than Y, and some information is conveyed to viewers more clearly.
