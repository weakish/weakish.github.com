4. 34 min 53 seconds version streamed online during the 3rd Hong Kong Onscreen Film Festival (from 2025-08-23 to 2025-09-13). This version is denoted as V in the comparision below.

V has a warmer and brighter color grading than Y.

At the opening, after the close-up of Olivia’s arm, Y only shows the waterfall in the corner of the frame, whereas V adds a front-facing shot of Olivia wearing a mask behind the waterfall, which more clearly conveys that she stops to look at the waterfall, but slightly reduces the sense of mystery.

After Olivia exits the cave, V adds close-ups of Olivia’s black shoes and Jack’s white shoes (the two do not recognize each other at this moment), implying that the places Jack and Olivia choose to visit before going to prison overlap. It also adds a water reflection of Olivia’s face, leaving a deeper impression so that when they meet again later, audiences can recall that they had already crossed paths.

In Y, after Jack’s phone call with his mother, and before Jack comes to his alma mater (St Joseph’s College), there is an added scene of Jack walking out of Hong Kong Park, which implies that the places Jack and Olivia choose to visit before going to prison overlap. This assumes that audiences are able to recognize that the opening is shot in Hong Kong Park. Also, if audiences are familiar with the location of St Joseph’s College, knowing that it is next to the park, then this transition makes a bit more sense.

When Jack comes to his alma mater, there is a scene where the guard asks what Jack is there for and requests ID and LeaveHomeSafe (a mobile app used in Hong Kong for COVID-19 contact tracing and venue check-in). In Y, there is a shot of the guard watching Jack warily; in V there is no frontal shot of the guard, and removing the facial expression of the guard reduces the tension between them. V then adds a scene where another staff member (Mister Fai 輝叔) recognizes Jack, pulls down his mask, and chats casually, further softening the relationship between Jack and the school. In the small talk, Mister Fai asks about Jack’s situation; Jack answers he’s emigrating to the UK after a short pause, and Mister Fai says he’s moving to Vancouver to reunite with his children. This matches Jack later telling Mister Wong (黃 Sir) that he will go to Vancouver, highlighting that both the UK and Vancouver are just making up stories because he doesn’t want to tell others he’s about to be imprisoned.

After the alma mater scenes, the Old Supreme Court Building is used as a transition in Y, which is symbolic and, for audiences familiar with Hong Kong, also hints at Jack’s location. V removes this transition, perhaps to avoid repetition, because the Old Supreme Court Building is later used again as a transition between Jack walking on the street and Olivia walking on the street.

In Y, after Olivia’s walking-on-the-street scene, a Hong Kong nightscape is used as a transition before Jack seeing Olivia; V deletes the nightscape transition, trims Olivia’s walking scene, and removes the masked close-up of Olivia’s face, probably because V already presented her face at the opening.

Between the scene that Jack recalling Olivia shouting “run” during the protests in 2019 and the scene that Olivia sitting at the cafe, V inserts a short scene of Olivia walking on the street, implying Jack followed her to the cafe.

In the conversation where Olivia tells Jack that someone asked whether she was afraid to go to Vancouver alone, Y ends with Jack saying it wouldn’t be bad for you to go to Vancouver to have a child, Olivia saying this place really isn’t suitable for having a child, and Jack joking, “then have two children” (in Cantonese  can mean a child in general or specifically a boy, so actually Jack joking "then have a girl", while the English word “child” is gender-neutral, so the English subtitles changes the joke a bit). This joke lightens the heavy mood of the previous conversation, followed by a cheerful sequence of the two running and jumping in the streets. They finally stop in front of a chain-link fence and look at each other in silence; after descending the footbridge they see across the street the slogan “25 Years Since the Handover, Hong Kong Creates the Future.” Jack then sees the red minibus next to the slogan and sighs, “Over there in Vancouver, there are no red minibuses to ride,” to which Olivia pauses and then replies, “Yes.” In V, the two run and jump in the street after leaving the cafe, then talk in front of the chain-link fence, and the conversation ends directly with Olivia saying it’s not suitable to have a child, cutting Jack’s joke. After the conversation, they see the “25 Years Since the Handover, Hong Kong Creates the Future” slogan across the street and start the conversation about red minibuses. V moves the conversation to in front of the chain-link fence, more strongly implying that what Olivia and Jack are actually talking about is someone asking whether she’s afraid of going to jail. Also, removing the silent eye contact at the fence reduces the heaviness.

At the end of Y, the two board the minibus to report to the police station and walk along the aisle between the seats. V adds additional scenes showing them seated and the bus in motion, ending on the roadside lights and the Old Supreme Court Building lit up as the bus drives past, suggesting the two are ultimately heading toward a bright future of judicial justice.

Overall, V is more polished, warmer, and softer than Y.
