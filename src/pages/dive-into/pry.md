# Dive into Pry

## Input

- `!`: clear input buffer
- `code;`: suppress evaluation output, useful when it's long or uninterested.
- `amend-line N replacement code`: to amend lines of input. Use `!` for replacement to delete. You can use `show-input` to get line numbers.
- `.shellcommad #{ruby code}`

## Special locals

- `_`: last result
- `_ex_`: the most recently caught exception
- `_in_` and `_out_`: Input expressions and output results are automatically stored in array-like data structures.
- `_file_` and `_dir_`: last file and last directory
- `_pry_`: current Pry instance

## Browsing code

Use `cd` to move into a object or scope.
As in UNIX shells use `cd ..` to go
back, `cd /` to return to Pry top-level and `cd -` to toggle between last two
scopes. Complex syntax (e.g `cd ../@x/@y`) also supported.

Use `whereami`(alias `@`) to show code surrounding the current context.

Use `show-source`(alias `$` or `show-method`) and `show-code`(alias `?`).

Use `find-method` to recursively search for a method within a class/module or the current namespace.

Use `stat method_name` for basic method information.

Use `ls` to get a list of variables in current scope
You can also use `ls Class/Module`, or `ls variable`.

Use `watch` to watch the value of an expression and print a notification whenever it changes.

`cat` automatic syntax highlighting for a number of file types.

`cat` accepts the following options:

- `--[l]inenumbers` causes line numbers to be displayed along side each line.
- `--[t]ype`: syntax highlight type
- `--[s]tart` and `--[e]nd`: the line of the file with which to begin/end
- `--ex`: last exception
- `--in`: one or more entries from Pry's expression history (default: -5..-1)

## Editing code

`edit` brings you to `EDITOR`.
It accepts the following options:

* `-c`: current file/line
* `my_method`: method in the scope
* `Class#a_method` or `Class.a_class_method`
* `<filename>` or `<filename>:<line-number>`
* `--in 1..2`: a range of the Pry input buffer
* `-t`: open a temporary empty file in an editor
* `--ex`: the relevant file at the line that generated the last exception
* `--ex N`: the Nth line of the backtrace
* `-l`: jump to the specified line number
* `-n`: stop the automatic reloading of `.rb` files after you have edited them
* `-r`: force Pry to reload and eval a file, even if it does not end in `.rb`

Being run without any arguments, the `edit` command modifies the last input expression.

## History

`hist` to display Pry history.

It accepts the following options:

- `--grep REGEX`
- `--exclude`: when displaying history, exclude pry commands
- `--tail N` and `--head N`: `N` defaults to 10
- `--no-numbers` or `-n`: turns off line numbers when displaying history
- `--show A..B`
- `--replay A..B`: replay lines of history.
- `--save [A..B] FILE`: save to a file
- `--clear`: clear all current session history

## Debug

Write `binding.pry` as a breakpoint in your code. When executing, it
will stop here and open a Pry console.

## Gems

- `gem-cd` Change working directory to specified gem's directory.
- `gem-install` Install a gem and refresh the gem cache.
- `gem-list` List and search installed gems.
- `gem-open` Opens the working directory of the gem in your editor.

## Customization

For current session:

```ruby
Pry.config.[option]
```

You can store `Pry.config.[option]` in `.pryrc` (project or global `~/.pryrc`).

## Plugins

### pry-byebug

Use `byebug` (Ruby debugger) with pry.

I don't use it due to [this bug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug/issues/44).
Besides, most of time, I just need pry-rescue.

## pry-coolline

By default, code gets highlighted after you end your input.
This plugin supports real time highlight.

## pry-macro

Record and play macros.
You can save macros to a file.

### pry-rescue

Whenever an unhandled exception happens in your program, pry-rescue opens an interactive pry shell right at the point it was raised.

Install it together with `pry-stack_explorer`, then run `rescue file.rb` instead of `ruby file.rb`.

In the rescue Pry session, use `up` and `down` to move around the stack, and use `wtf?` or `cat --ex` to examine stack traces and the associated code.
After identifying the problem, use `edit-method` (alias `$`) to fix the code, and `try-again` to verify the fix worked.

`cd-cause` lets you rewind back the previously raised exception. So, if you've rescued one exception, and then raised another (it happensâ€¦) you can jump back to the original cause of the problem.

You can also call `Pry::rescue` to control over which parts of your code are rescued:

```ruby
require 'pry-rescue'

def test
  raise "foo"
rescue => e
  raise "bar"
end

Pry.rescue do
  test
end
```

You can also use `Pry::rescue` in the `rescue` clause:

```ruby
def test
  raise "foo"
rescue => e
  Pry::rescued(e)
end

Pry::rescue{ test }
```

#### Testing

##### rspec

```sh
rescue rspec
```

##### MiniTest

Add the following to your `test_helper.rb` or to the top of your test file

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'pry-rescue/minitest'
```

It works perfectly with `yard-doctest` in terminal, but not is
sublime-text.

## Themes

In a pry session, run `pry-theme list` to list all installed themes.

Try a theme:

```pry
pry-theme try pry-modern-256
```

If the theme is not installed, you can install it:

```pry
pry-theme install theme-name
```

You can use `uninstall` to uninstall it.

Show current theme:

```pry
pry-theme current
```

You can edit a theme:

```pry
pry-theme edit
```

After you have decided your theme, write it in `.pryrc`:

```ruby
Pry.config.theme = "pry-modern-256"
```

You can get more themes at [Pry theme collection](https://github.com/kyrylo/pry-theme-collection).
