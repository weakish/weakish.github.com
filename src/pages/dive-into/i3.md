# i3 Quick Start

## Keybindings

When starting i3 without a config file, i3-config-wizard will let you choose Alt or Win as the Modifier, and generate a configure file.
However, it will generate keybindings based on the key **positions** of QWERTY layout.
Since I am using dvorak, so I copied `/etc/i3/config to ~/.config/i3/config` and replaced `Mod1` (`Alt`) with `Mod4` (`Win`) instead.

| $mod+key                 | function                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Enter                    | terminal                           |
| d                        | dmenu                              |
| Arrow Keys               | move focus                         |
| Shift+Arrow Keys         | move window                        |
| 0-9                      | switch workspace 10,1,...,9        |
| Shift+0-9                | switch workspace 10,1,...,9        |
| a                        | navigate one container up the tree |
| h/v                      | split container splith/v           |
| e                        | toggle splith/v                    |
| f                        | toggle fullscreen                  |
| s/w                      | stacking/tabbed                    |
| Shift+Space              | toggle floating                    |
| Shift+q                  | close window                       |
| Shift+r                  | restart i3                         |
| Shift+e                  | exit i3                            |
| Secondary mouse button   | adjust window size                 |
| r                        | enter resize mode                  |

Notes:

1. By default i3 uses `dmenu_run`, displaying all commands in `$PATH`. To only display applications shipping a `.desktop` file, replace `dmenu_run` with `i3-dmenu-desktop` instead.
2. Multiple screens share workspaces. Workspace will be bound to the focused screen on its creation. Switching to a workspace will focus its screen.
3. In resize mode, press arrow keys (or `jkl;` to resize focused window: Left/Right: shirk/grow width; Up/Down: shrink/grow height; Esc: escape resize mode.

## Configurations

Edit `~/.config/i3/config`:

```
# No title bar, window borders
default_border none
# For old versions
# new_window none
# When already on workspace N, $mod+N will switch to the previous focused workspace
workspace_auto_back_and_forth yes
# Hide i3bar
bar {
    mode hide
    status_command i3status
}
# Lock screen
# keybinding inspired by macOS
bindsym Mod4+Ctrl+q exec --no-startup-id "i3lock -i $HOME/Pictures/wallpaper/F14-final-wallpaper-updated.png"
# i3lock-img is a shell script of the above i3lock command line
exec_always --no-startup-id "xautolock -time 1 -locker i3lock-img"
```

## Layouts

A container contains windows or containers.

A container has one of the following layouts:

| switch keys | layout | move focus |
| - | - | - |
| `$mod+e` | tiling (it toggles splitv/splith) | `$mod+up/down/left/right` (depends on orientation) |
| `$mod+s` | stacking | `$mod+up/down` |
| `$mod+w` | tabbed | `$mod+left/right` |

And `$mod+f` will toggle fullscreen mode of the current window.

A new opened window will appear in the current container, next to the current window:

- tiling: right/below
- stacking: below
- tabbed: right

A new container can be created explicitly by splitting the current container vertically (`$mod+v`) or horizontally (`$mod+h`).
And moving windows may implicitly create containers.

For example, suppose we have three windows in a splith container (window c is focused):

```
|a|b|c*|
```

`$mod+Shift+Up` results in the following layout:

```
|  c*   |
| a | b |
```

Here window a and b are in an implicitly created new container.
That is,

```
splith             splitv
 / | \    --->      /   \
a  b  c            c   splith
                        /  \
                       a    b
```

Similarly, if we focus window a (`$mod+Down`), and move it up (`$mod+Shift+Up`):

```
| c  |
| a* |
| b  |
```

then move it left (`$mod+Shift+Left`), we will get the following layout:

```
|    | c |
| a* |
|    | b |
```

Let's review the whole process:

```
|a|b|c*|  --> |  c*   |  --> | c  | --> |    | c |
              | a | b |      | a* |     | a* |   |
                             | b  |     |    | b |

splith             splitv             splitv           splith
 / | \    --->      /   \       --->   / | \   --->     /   \
a  b  c            c   splith         a  b  c          a    splitv
                        /  \                                 /  \
                       a    b                               c    b
```

## KDE

You can use i3 with other desktop environments such as [KDE].

[KDE]: https://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/Using_Other_Window_Managers_with_Plasma

If you use i3 in KDE, you may want to uncomment the `xautolock` line above to lock screen via kDE.
Also, vertical KDE panel is not supported under i3.
