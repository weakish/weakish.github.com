# Log

With the popularity of smart mobile phones, I think the 140 limit of #twitter
becomes pointless. Sure, brevity is beautiful. But encouraging brevity, rather
than enforcing brevity, feels better to me. Sometimes it's just not practical
to express your idea in 140 characters. Under that condition, 'Expand this
post' in #Google + is much more user-friendly than twitter's 'click this short
url and go to another site in a new tab'.

I was wrong. The 140 characters limit is enough for a microblog.
Otherwise it is either not micro, or not a log at all.
It is not for expressing ideas.
