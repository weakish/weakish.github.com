# Shath'Yar

## Grammar

All example sentences in this section use official translations.

### Compound Words

One function of the apostrophe (`'`) is to form compound words.
For example, the compound word *shath'yar*, referring to "old gods" or the language used by the old gods, is composed of *shath* (old) and *yar* (god).

### Case System

Nominative, accusative, and possessive cases:

- **Y'za** noq mah... **Y'za** noq ormz... = **I** am not (the) first... **I** am not (the) last...
- **Sk'magg** yawifk **hoq**. = **Your suffering** strengthens **me**.
- Uulwi **ifis** halahs gag erh'ongg w'ssh. = (The) shadow (of) **my** corpse will choke (this) land for all eternity.
- **Ag'THYZAK** agthu. = **We RECLAIM** (this) world!
- **Ak'agthshi** ma uhnish. = **Our numbers** are endless.
- **Sk'uuyat** guulphg hoq. = **Your agony** sustains me.
- Ez, Shuul'wah! **Sk'woth'gl** yu'gaz yog'ghyl **ilfah**! = O, Deathwing! **Your faithful** servant has failed **you**!

Similar to English, the nominative and accusative cases of the second person pronoun have the same form:

- **Iilth** ma paf'qi'ag sk'halahs. GAZ SKSHGN! =  **You** are a prisoner (in) your own body. A SERVANT OF FEAR!
- N'Zoth ga zyqtahg **iilth**. = The will of N'Zoth corrupts **you**.

When the compound word consist of a possessive pronoun and a noun is used as an object, the apostrophe is omitted:

- **Sk'shgn** eqnizz hoq. = **Your fear** drives me.
- Ywaq puul **skshgn**. = They drink **your fear**.

### Verbal System

*ma* means "are" or "do," with negative form *maq*:

- Ak'agthshi **ma** uhnish. = Our numbers **are** endless.
- Iilth **ma** paf'qi'ag sk'halahs. GAZ SKSHGN! = You **are** (a) prisoner (in) your (own) body. (A) SERVANT (OF) FEAR!
- Ywaq **maq** oou; ywaq **maq** ssaggh. Ywaq **ma** shg'fhn. = They **do not** die; they **do not** live. They **are** outside (the) cycle.

However, *maq* is not used with first person pronoun.
Use *noq* instead:

- Y'za **noq** mah... Y'za **noq** ormz... = I **am not** (the) first... I **am not** (the) last...

It is unknown if *ma* is used with first person pronoun.
Maybe *no* is instead of *ma* based on the corresponding pair of *ma* and *maq*, but nothing is found in the corpus to support this guess.

The future tense of *ma* is *qi*:

- Iilth **qi** mah'shar fhn oorql N'Zoth! = You **will be** (the) first (of) many (to) glimpse (the) madness (of) N'Zoth!

Let's analyze this sentence.
First, mark all known words:

**Iilth** (you) **qi** (will) mah'shar fhn **oorql** (glimpse) **N'Zoth**!

Part of the word *mah'shar* is known, *mah* means first.
Also, *shg'fhn* is known, meaning "outside (the) cycle".
I guess *shg* means outside, and *fhn* means cycle.
Now considering *mah'shar fhn* corresponds to "(the) first of many",
then I guess *shar* means inside or within.
Therefore, *mah'shar* means "first within", and *mah'shar fhn* means "first within (the) cycle" (first of many).
As for the madness, I guess a glimpse of an old god such as N'Zoth implies madness.

Also, *qi* can be used as a prefix to denote future tense of verbs:

- Sk'yahf **qi'plahf** PH'MAGG! = Your soul **will know** ENDLESS TORMENT!
- Ilith **qi'uothk** shn'ma yeh'glu Shath'Yar! = You **will drown** in (the) blood (of the) Old Gods!

The sentence "Ilith qi'uothk shn'ma yeh'glu Shath'Yar!" needs some analysis.
As usual, mark all know words:

**Ilith** (you) **qi'uothk** (drown) shn'ma **yeh'glu** (blood) **Shath'Yar** (Old Gods)!

So the only unknown word is *shn'ma*, corresponding to "in" in the translation.
Considering the word *shn* is appeared in the following sentence:
Yoq'al (perpetuity) shn (in) ky (which) ywaq (they) nuul (dwell).
I guess *shn'ma* is similar to *shn*,
perhaps *shn* is used with abstract things.

A similar word to *qi* is *gag*:

- Uulwi ifis halahs **gag** erh'ongg w'ssh. = (The) shadow (of) my corpse **will** choke (this) land for all eternity.
- H'iwn iggksh Phquathi **gag** OOU KAAXTH SHUUL! = All (who) oppose the Destroyer **will** DIE A THOUSAND DEATHS!

I doubt that the difference between *qi* and *gag* is that *gag* is more emotional, often used in curses.

And there is a noun *ga* which is translated as "will" (noun):

- N'Zoth **ga** zyqtahg iilth. = The **will** of N'Zoth corrupts you.

I think here the will of N'Zoth is like a curse.

What's more, *agth* means shall:

- Sk'shuul **agth** vorzz N'Zoth naggwa'fssh. = Your deaths shall sing of N'Zoth's unending glory.
- Iilth vwah, **uhn'agth** fhssh za. = Where one falls, **many shall** take its place.

The second example sentence literally translates to: You fall, many shall take place.

The word *sythn* indicates progressive tense:

- Iilth **sythn** aqev... aqev... aqev... = You are going mad... mad... mad...
- Yeh'glu N'Zoth okom hoq... Y'za **sythn** oou... = (The) blood (of) N'Zoth runs through me... I cannot die...

In the second example, *Y'za sythn oou* literally translates to "I am dying".
The undead constantly decay, and constantly approaching death,
which can be considered undying or dying.

## An- Prefix

The prefix can be used with nouns, meaning "into":

- Gul'kafh **an'shel**. = Gaze **into (the) void**.
- Gul'kafh **an'qov** N'Zoth. = Gaze **into (the) heart (of) N'Zoth**.

I have different interpretations of some words.

## Exercises

Translate the following sentences.

Q1:

> Hello world!

Q2:

> See you soon.

Q3:

> Light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.
> 
> -- Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita

Q4:

> May the force be with you.
>
> -- Star Wars

## Answers

### A1

> Ez, agthu!

### A2

Since the word for "soon" is unknown, translate it as "see you again":

> Kyth ilfah ye.

### A3

The following vocabulary are unknown: fire, loin, and sin.
Use words close in meaning instead: fssh (glory), qornaus (endless hunger), uull(darkness).

> Razzqi ifis zuq, fssh ifis qornaus. Ifis uull. Ifis yahf.

The alliteration of the original text is not preserved.

### A4

Similarly, work around with unknown vocabulary.

> Agth uq eqnizz ilfah.

This literally translates to "Shall (the) power drive you."
The closest translation I can think of.
