# Translation of Two Similar Terms for Making Ends Meet in Literary Chinese

When translating Literary Chinese to English, both 稻粱謀 and 餬口 can be translated to "making ends meet".
However, there are more accurate translations.

粱 refers to the finest quality millet and 稻 (rice) was mainly produced in the Yangtze River basin thus hard to obtain in the Yellow River basin in the ancient times.
稻粱謀, literally means "seeking rare and high quality food", can be translated to "pursue a decent life".

On the other hand, 餬口 literally means "to feed one's mouth with gruel", can be translated to "eke out a livelihood".

# 「稻粱謀」異乎「餬口」

粱謂粟之精良者，北地產稻稀少，二者皆不易得，故古人往往以稻粱連稱。是「稻粱謀」異乎「餬口」也。今粱、稻皆易得，則時移世易矣！
