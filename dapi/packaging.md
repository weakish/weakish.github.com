The general approach is to streamline clothing and choose garments that are easy to carry.

1. Choose lightweight clothing. For example, avoid heavy leather coats.
2. Choose soft clothing that can be rolled up for storage. Avoid clothing that cannot be rolled up.
3. If underwear is insufficient, it can be purchased along the way. For example, Walmart's Comfort series (includes disposable underwear, and even non-disposable underwear is inexpensive).
4. Long down jackets can be worn on the body. If there's a large temperature difference between departure and destination, or if the destination itself has large temperature variations, choose lightweight down jackets or even lightweight down vests.
5. Merino wool sweaters are relatively lightweight, and breathable fibers are also suitable for environments with large temperature differences.
6. If there's high activity levels or the environment is relatively humid, you can choose fabrics with strong breathability like AIRism. I don't recommend fabrics like HEATTECH that absorb sweat for warmth - the heating effect may not be that good, but it significantly reduces comfort.
7. Multi-layered combinations of lightweight clothing are the secret to dealing with environments with large temperature differences.
7. Try to bring as few shoes as possible. The inside of shoes can be stuffed with other things, like socks.
