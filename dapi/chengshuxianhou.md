# How to Examine the Chronological Order of Book Composition

Generally speaking, when determining the chronological order of entire books without considering excavated texts:

1. Records by books of established dates (mostly bibliographic works) regarding the composition circumstances of the two books.
2. Judgment based on linguistic features such as character usage, grammar, and literary style.
3. Research into the chronological order of authors.
4. Judgment based on historical facts involved (including specific historical events and intellectual trends and customs of certain eras).
5. Citation circumstances of these two books by other books of established dates.

The chronological order of certain passages within two books may not necessarily match the chronological order of the two books themselves, for example:

I. Book A is earlier than Book B, but a certain passage in A was actually supplemented by later people based on B (this includes cases where A originally had this passage or similar content, but it was later damaged, so later people used passages from B to supplement it, as well as cases where A originally had no similar content at all, but later people used content from B to supplement it to make A more complete).
II. Both A and B actually copied from an earlier C.
III. A copied from C, B copied from D.

For case I, the above methods for determining the dating of entire books equally apply:

1. Books of established dates record circumstances of later people supplementing A, or record that by a certain time some part of A had already been lost, and the target passage happens to be in the lost part.
2. Same as above.
3. Determining the author helps limit the scope - for example, an author of a certain era could not possibly have written the target passage.
4. Same as above.
5. Examine citation circumstances of the target passage.
6. The degree of consistency between the target passage and the entire book.
7. Comparison of the target passage in the two books.

Point 7 is somewhat more complex. For example, if A is detailed and B is brief, there are two possibilities:

7.1 B is early, A is late - A embellished based on B.
7.2 A is early, B is late - B summarized A's record.

This judgment is quite complex and requires considering multiple factors - too much to write out fully.

Here's an example:

A briefly records that M from place Y in country X did something disgraceful.
B records in detail the specific process of M from country X doing the disgraceful thing, including dialogue and even psychological activities, but doesn't mention place Y.

If we assume A summarized B, then since B didn't record Y, how did A know about place Y? Unless A learned it from C, which belongs to case II and won't be discussed here. If we say A embellished, why were all other details omitted while only place Y was added? Unless there are other factors (for example, A's author disliked people from place Y, so intentionally attributed this record to place Y, or B's author was from place Y and omitted place Y to avoid bringing shame to his hometown), we don't lean toward A having summarized B.

Then we consider B having embellished A, and find that B's detailed description of the process better explains B's argument, so omitting the detail of place Y was likely because B's author thought this detail about place Y was useless.

Thus we lean toward B being later than A. Of course, it's possible that B missed the two characters "place Y" when copying A, or that later people missed them when copying B. But when enough similar tendential evidence is collected, it can explain the problem.

For case II:

If C still exists and its date is established, there's nothing much to discuss.

If C exists but its date is uncertain, then apply methods 1-5 to A, B, and C.

If C has been lost or it's uncertain whether C exists:

1. Books of established dates record circumstances of A or B copying C.
2. If linguistic analysis results show that the target passage doesn't match the composition dates of either A or B, but rather reflects characteristics of an era earlier than both.
3. Same as above.
4. Same as above.
5. Same as above - citing the target passage without attributing it to A or B, but instead indicating C.

III. Apply the above methods by analogy to examining C and D.

The above are general methods. For examining the dates of ancient books from pre-Qin and Han periods, one must first have awareness of "separate original circulation": originally they were individual pieces, and what we see now are all later compilations. For example, both "Zhuangzi" and "Liezi" are later compilations.

Yu Jiaxi's "General Principles of Ancient Books" states: "Ancient authors had no specialized collections; they often wrote several pieces at random and circulated them. Those who transmitted their learning each titled books based on what they obtained," "Even their daily responses to human affairs, composed as letters and treatises, also served to illuminate their scholarly principles. Though the language varied in a hundred ways, it didn't depart from their main doctrine. Those who inherited their learning gathered and compiled them, and also attached what they had seen and heard, and what later teachers had lectured on and practiced to illuminate their meaning, thus forming one school's learning. Therefore, there were no literary collections before the Western Han, and the various masters' works were their literary collections. It's not that their writing wasn't beautiful, but because they were vehicles for subtle words and great meanings, their words had substance and didn't merely embellish phrases," "Their books were not composed at one time, and their chronological order was entirely without sequence. Whatever was written at any time was circulated then."

Therefore, for books from pre-Qin and Han periods, it's inappropriate to speak generally about their dating. We need to distinguish:

1. When did the version we see now take shape?
2. When did the earliest embryo of this book roughly appear?

Then for the dating of specific passages, we can only refer to points 1 and 2 above, cannot directly apply conclusions, and may well need further examination.

Due to the characteristics of how pre-Qin and Han books were composed, excavated texts remain the most convenient and direct method.
