## Washing Inner and Outer Clothes Together or Using Public Washing Machines

To avoid cross-infection:

0. Use disinfectant like Dettol
1. Use 60-degree hot water

## Sweaters

0. Buy machine-washable sweaters.
1. Choose the gentlest mode.
2. Choose pH-neutral, gentle detergent, or you can also use shampoo (after all, the raw material of sweaters is sheep's hair).
3. Turn the sweater inside out and put it in a mesh bag or pillowcase to reduce wear.
4. Do not use the dryer. Avoid hanging sweaters on hangers to dry, as the weight of water will stretch and deform the sweater. It's recommended to lay the sweater flat on a rack to dry.
5. If you don't mind deformation, sweaters marked as "not machine washable" on the care label can still be machine washed, and can also be hung on hangers to dry after washing.
