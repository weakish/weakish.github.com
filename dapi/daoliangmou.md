Liang (粱) refers to the finest quality millet. Rice was rarely produced in the northern regions, and both were not easy to obtain, so the ancients often referred to them together as "rice and fine millet" (稻粱). Thus "seeking rice and fine millet" (稻粱謀) is not the same as merely "making ends meet" (餬口). Now that both fine millet and rice are easily available, times have indeed changed!
