> Entering a tree is possible
> Entering rocks is also possible
> When I recall the past
> I feel I'm within them

-- "Recalling in a Tree," p. 1

> Things are always entangled together, the known parts always give rise to more unknown parts.

-- "Recalling in a Tree," p. 2

Note: "Known" should be "already." "Known" and "unknown" are different from "already known" and "not yet known."

> Ning: I was a bit afraid to go to Tibet without finishing this book. Why do I say this?
> It's because after it changes there, including after the area near our No. 6 Middle School changed,
> I feel it would be a kind of devastation to me. That is to say,
> if I went there before fixing that world in words, I would destroy myself.
>
> Lin: Then everything original would be dissolved.
>
> Ning: Then it wouldn't be the same flavor as my original thing.

-- "Conversations on Tibet," p. 149

Note: "Ning" refers to "Ning Ken," "Lin" refers to "Lin Yue." Both lived near Lhasa No. 6 Middle School during their "aid to Tibet" work in the 1980s.

Commentary: "After it changes there," "it's not the same flavor as my original thing," so the countermeasure is to "fix that world in words." 
But isn't "fixing that world in words" also "a kind of devastation"?
Every time we recall, some imaginative elements are added, and some things are distorted by imagination.
"Fixing in words" is even more so - after all, compared to memory, words are one-dimensional and more prone to distortion.
"After it changes there," "the original thing" is "not the same flavor." The effectiveness of textual fixation is limited.

> Ning: If we can avoid using words everyone is used to saying, we don't use them. Find expressions that are both our own and ordinary yet appropriate.
> ...
> Ning: When describing the sky, it's always "sky high and clouds light," "clouds bloom and sky opens," "moon above the willow tips, people meet at dusk" - don't expect to find such ready-made language in my book.
> ...
> Ning: Actually, some words have been worn out from overuse, scrapped.
> ...
> Ning: If I can't express with a new language, like that kind of scenery, or character introduction—
> ...
> Ning: ... I'd rather use the most plain language, the most straightforward, most daily, most basic vocabulary to express.
> I don't know if you remember Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman," the opening left a deep impression on me:
> "Tonight, very good moonlight."
> Lin: That's something even a first-grade elementary student could write.
> Ning: Exactly! Very clear, the moonlight is very good tonight. It's not like saying, "Tonight the moonlight is like water" or "bright moon in the sky" - what would that become!
> ...
> Ning: It's not like what hack writers often write. It returns directly to the most fundamental, most primitive language: the moonlight is very good tonight. Damn, how authentic!
> ... I say language, if you can't innovate, return to authenticity, return here.
> ...
> Ning: Ah, return to the original, return to the most plain, most accurate. If you have innovation, use innovation; if not, return to this.
> ...
> Ning: This is like a bottom line of language. You always stand on this bottom line of language, stand on the most basic. If you don't step out, you don't step out.
> Once you step out, it must reach another extreme that others cannot surpass, otherwise retreat to the bottom line.
> ...
> Ning: Never both fail to retreat to the bottom line and lack innovation, using that gorgeous, specious, parroted, ready-made [language].

-- "Conversations on Tibet," pp. 161-163

Commentary: Actually, the language of technical texts pursues plainness and accuracy. Literature pursues interest beyond plainness and accuracy.
The so-called "gorgeous, specious, parroted, ready-made" lacks both interest and accuracy, truly "worn out from overuse."
Inaccuracy is also similar to what Wang Guowei called "separation" in "Remarks on Poetry in the Human World."

> Ning: Say what it is, just say what it is. Like the opening of my "Sky・Tibet," it's just a declarative sentence with no adjectives:
> "When my friend Wang Mo saw Martin, snow had already drifted through that afternoon."
> ...
> Ning: You say simple or not simple? It's the simplest, but how many complex means does it actually take to find it?
> For me to finally find this sentence, this opening, was too difficult - how many openings before this opening.

-- "Conversations on Tibet," p. 164

Commentary: The word choice is indeed plain and accurate. But this sentence structure isn't plain - it still has a "literary" air. At the same time, this sentence structure can't be called innovative either.
Therefore, this opening is a negative example - we must pay attention not only to word choice but also to sentence structure.
This opening is dragged down by its sentence structure and can't be called "the simplest." Actually, ordinary people wouldn't normally think of this kind of sentence structure when casually thinking of an opening.
It's precisely people heavy on literary airs who, racking their brains, easily think of this kind of sentence structure. Too much effort.
Of course, I'm not saying using great effort is necessarily bad, but effort is effort - showing traces of effort isn't beautiful.
"Natural without carving" is very good; "made up but appearing natural" is also not bad.
If it's a plastic surgery "beauty" that anyone can tell at a glance, then this plastic surgery skill doesn't seem very good either.

> Ning: ... Yes, I once wrote a piece on Tibet for a fashion magazine. Oh, it made me so uncomfortable, uncomfortable to death. I never wrote again after that.
> I even tell you, I'm not as good as what they write, because they write so slickly,
> those clichés they write are so smooth, I really can't do it.

-- "Conversations on Tibet," p. 179

> The process of travel is a process of intensely becoming aware of the interaction between self and other. This process is one of the breeding grounds of literature.
> The great Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset once said: Tell me what you pay attention to, and I will tell you who you are.
> People often create themselves through what they pay attention to. No matter where we direct our attention, we are shaped by it.
> You pay attention to the distance, and the distance will surely shape you. You pay attention to travel, and travel will surely shape you. In this sense, Ortega y Gasset further said:
> "Life itself is a poetic work. Man is his own novelist, so life is actually a literary form."

-- "A Person's Path—My Autobiography," p. 203

> After passing through large areas of chaotic modern architecture, the Humble Administrator's Garden didn't bring me joy.
> On the contrary, it was sandwiched like a specimen in infinite chaos.

-- "Taizhou・Questions and Answers," p. 266

I've written similar texts before. The feeling Suzhou gave me was that some ancient remains were cast into the modern ocean.
This strange sense of discord made me very uncomfortable. I could only comfort myself by saying that many cities don't even have the opportunity to feel this discomfort.
Later, when I sometimes saw articles in the media saying it was "a perfect combination of classical and modern," I sighed that everyone really has their own ideas.
If you ask me, it should be "a perfect non-combination of classical and modern."
