# Postscript on Collection of Chinese Linguistics Papers

When I saw the article "Tonal Relationships Between Two Components in Parallel Alliterative Phrases in Chinese" (pp. 299-314), I had a sense of familiarity. Could it be that I had seen this article elsewhere before?

When I was recently browsing and searching through books, I found it by chance. It turns out that Yu Jiaxi's "Annotations and Commentary on Shishuo Xinyu" contains related discussions, which I had seen before - no wonder it felt familiar!

"Shishuo Â· Ridicule" records: "Minister Zhuge and Prime Minister Wang debated the precedence of their family names. Wang said: 'Why not say Ge-Wang, but Wang-Ge?' The minister said: 'For example, when saying donkey-horse, we don't say horse-donkey - does that mean donkey is superior to horse?'" Yu Jiaxi's "Annotations and Commentary" states: "When mentioning two names together, if their tones are different but there is no fixed precedence, like Xia-Shang, Kong-Yan and such, then the level tone always comes first and the oblique tone comes second. This follows the natural flow of sound, and it was already so before the four-tone system existed. Therefore, saying Wang-Ge and donkey-horse instead of Ge-Wang and horse-donkey is not about determining superiority or inferiority. Examples include Gong-Gu, Su-Li, Ji-Ruan, Pan-Lu, Xing-Wei, Xu-Yu, Yan-Xu, Wang-Meng, Han-Liu, Yuan-Bai, Wen-Li, and so forth." (1983)

This article by Ding was first published in the second issue of Volume 39 of "Bulletin of the Institute of History and Philology" in 1969 (pp. 155-147). "Annotations and Commentary on Shishuo Xinyu" was a posthumous work of Mr. Yu Jiaxi. After Mr. Yu's death in 1955, it was compiled by Zhou Zumo and others. Due to various reasons, publication was repeatedly delayed, and it was finally published by Zhonghua Book Company in 1983. Both Yu and Ding independently noticed this problem, and their views were similar - this is what's meant by "building a cart behind closed doors, yet it fits the ruts when taken out." (Ding's scope of attention was broader, not limited to parallel personal names, nor just to cases where level tone precedes oblique tone. However, the second part of his article, "Main Discussion," first discusses the problem of parallel family names, which is similar in purpose to Yu's work.)
