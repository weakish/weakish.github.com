# Postscript on Huang Kan's Hand-Annotated Plain Text Thirteen Classics

Huang Kan's Hand-Annotated Plain Text Thirteen Classics. Annotated by Huang Kan. Beijing: Zhonghua Book Company, May 2006. ISBN 7-101-04909-5

According to Huang Zhuo's "Explanation," the punctuation follows old commentaries and primarily adopts one school's interpretation. For example, in "Erya Â· Shi Xu" there is one case that follows Guo's commentary for punctuation, but it should actually follow the punctuation from Zheng Xuan's "Zhouli Commentary" citation. Although Huang Kan knew that Zheng's interpretation was superior, he still followed Guo's punctuation.

Besides punctuation, there are more than forty types of symbols, involving paragraph division, spacing, emendation, erroneous characters, redundant text, missing text, four tones, variant readings, characters in regular script that differ from seal script, and so on. The symbols used for each classic also differ. For example: in the "Book of Documents," pseudo-ancient text with consecutive dots beside sentences indicates that such passages have genuine origins and were not forged by people of the Wei-Jin period; in the "Book of Songs," lines added to the right side of sentences indicate metaphorical meaning, lines connecting the lower left corner of the upper sentence with the upper left corner of the lower sentence indicate that the upper and lower sentences need to be read together grammatically, "/" added beside sentences indicates interrogative particles, quotation marks added to the corners of upper and lower sentences indicate that such sentences are words spoken by the people the poet is writing about, dots added to the left side of characters indicate that Zheng's commentary differs from Mao's tradition, curved lines connecting upper and lower characters indicate inverted sentences or indicate that commentaries supplement the meaning of the classics; in the "Rites of Zhou," lines added beside characters or sentences indicate that predecessors raised doubts about this, "[]" added above characters indicates redundant text; in "Spring and Autumn Annals with Zuo Commentary," consecutive circles under various characters indicate that Zuo's words involve principles throughout the entire book, straight lines beside sentences indicate "the gentleman said" or "Confucius said," triangles at the end of sentences indicate calligraphy; in "Spring and Autumn Annals with Gongyang Commentary" and "Spring and Autumn Annals with Guliang Commentary," red lines beside the last character of sentences indicate interrogative mood, lines beside sentences indicate interpretation of "Spring and Autumn Annals" calligraphy; in the "Analects," consecutive dots beside sentences indicate repetition, triangles beside characters indicate variant readings.

This book was published in photocopy by Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House in the 1980s, but the format was small, making it difficult to discern the small annotated text. Now Zhonghua Book Company has reprinted it in sextodecimo format, divided into two volumes.
