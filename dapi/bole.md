# Following the Map to Find a Horse

People say "Only when there is Bole in the world can there be thousand-li horses," which shows that "thousand-li horses" are Bole's invention. As for this "thousand-li" business, if horses had consciousness, they would probably disagree. The fortunate horses gallop freely in the wilderness, expressing their true nature; the unfortunate ones, though confined to stables, at least preserve their lives. However, the "thousand-li horses" favored by Bole must follow generals on campaigns everywhere, facing constant dangers and extraordinary hardships. When they finally die, if the master has some conscience and plans a grand burial, he might even be dissuaded by strategists: "The sage Confucius did not concern himself with horses. If you, my lord, lavishly bury a horse, it will dishearten the scholars who follow you. Better to cut it into small pieces and distribute the meat to everyone—let iron pots serve as coffins and stomachs as graves. This is the proper funeral for a horse."

Therefore, "Bole is not always present" is truly fortunate. If Bole were always around, who knows how many more "thousand-li horses" would die unnatural deaths. Just as "having talent but not meeting opportunity" is also fortunate. "Talent" (才) sounds like "wealth" (財), so "having talent but not meeting opportunity" is like "carrying wealth but not encountering bandits." If someone carries a fortune and walks alone in the dark night without meeting robbers or thieves, that is indeed fortunate.

If one is incompetent, that's even more fortunate. If a horse is incompetent, even when Bole approaches, it need not fear. It's like an ugly, poor woman walking at night—those who would rob wealth or violate virtue have nothing to target.

In Yang Shen's *Yi Lin Fa Shan* (Cutting Mountains in the Art Forest), Volume 7, there is a story about "following the map to find a horse":

> Bole's *Manual of Horse Evaluation* contains the phrase "high forehead and bulging eyes, hooves like stacked yeast cakes." His son, holding the *Manual*, went out to search for horses. When he saw a large toad, he told his father: "I found a horse that closely matches the description, except the hooves are not like stacked yeast cakes." Knowing his son's foolishness, Bole turned his anger into laughter and said: "This horse is good at jumping, but unsuitable for riding."

Bole's son, following his father's *Manual*, found a toad. I prefer to believe this was actually his way of expressing to Bole that he refused to evaluate horses. Having spent his life evaluating horses, Bole's son probably grew up in the company of horses. As a child, he might not have understood what "thousand-li ability" meant. What the child saw were one adorable horse after another, one horse after another that was kept for a while and then sent away, one horse after another that perished on battlefields and was buried in human bellies. Naturally, he could not approve of Bole's behavior, and certainly did not wish to evaluate horses himself. So he found a toad instead. This was Bole's son's foolishness. Bole had once recommended Jiufang Gao to Duke Mu of Qin, showing that he was also skilled at evaluating people, so he naturally understood his son's intention. That's why it says "Bole knew his son's foolishness, but turned his anger into laughter." First came anger, then helpless bitter laughter. "This horse is good at jumping, but unsuitable for riding" was his way of showing that he understood his son's meaning—the toad was a metaphor, suggesting that horses are by nature unruly and unsuitable for human control.
