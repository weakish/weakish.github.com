I haven't had time to read through it completely, but while browsing, I occasionally found two points worth discussing.

Chapter 9, Section 4 discusses Chen Li and Pi Xirui (pp. 729-739), and Section 5 discusses Liao Ping and Kang Youwei (pp. 740-767). Since Luomen was two years older than Jipian [Liao Ping], it's acceptable to place Pi before Liao, but there's not a single word throughout about Liao's influence on Pi - is this appropriate?

Chapter 3, Section 5 discusses Zheng Xuan's "Fa Mo Shou" (Breaking the Ink Defense), "Zhen Gao Huang" (Needling the Vital Spots), and "Qi Fei Ji" (Curing the Chronic Illness), and mentions He Xiu's "Gongyang Mo Shou" (Gongyang Ink Defense), "Zuoshi Gao Huang" (Zuoshi Vital Spots), and "Guliang Fei Ji" (Guliang Chronic Illness), saying: "He's three books are no longer extant, but judging from their titles, they should be defending Gongyang classical meanings to attack the wrongs of Zuo Commentary and Guliang." (p. 234) However, the "Mo Shou" (Ink Defense) in "Gongyang Mo Shou" is not based on "Mozi's skill in defense" from "Strategies of the Warring States." Mo means dark, silent, hidden. Shou, according to Bao Biao's commentary on "Strategies of the Warring States," means "like closing."[1] "Fa Mo Shou" means to reveal what is hidden and closed. Fa (reveal), Zhen (needle), and Qi (raise) are parallel terms, as are Mo Shou (ink defense), Gao Huang (vital spots), and Fei Ji (chronic illness). He Xiu's "Gongyang Jie Gu Xu" (Preface to Gongyang Commentary) says: "Those who transmit the Spring and Autumn are not few, originally based on disorder and composed, containing many extraordinary and strange theories worth questioning. Commentators are confused, even to the point of doubling the classics with arbitrary interpretations and going against tradition. Though the situation requires extensive discussion, it cannot but be broad, so the lectures of teachers amount to millions of words, yet there are still unresolved issues, sometimes adding mocking words, citing other classics, losing proper punctuation, treating non-existence as existence - the ridiculously laughable cases are countless. Therefore, those who study ancient learning and value literary style call them vulgar scholars, causing Jia Kui to seize the opportunity and take up his brush, thinking that Gongyang could be overthrown and Zuoshi could be promoted."[2] Therefore, He's "Gongyang Mo Shou" corrected the errors of Gongyang scholars of his time, namely those "vulgar scholars" who "lost proper punctuation, treating non-existence as existence, ridiculously laughable" and caused "Jia Kui" to think "Gongyang could be overthrown." The "Mo Shou" in "Gongyang Mo Shou" clearly does not mean defending Gongyang classical meanings. However, this misinterpretation actually began with Xu Yan. Xu's "Commentary" already states "composed 'Mo Shou' to resist enemy 'Chang Yi.'" Examining Xu's "Commentary," it cites He's "Gao Huang" and "Fei Ji," and also cites Zheng's "Fa Mo Shou," but never cites "Mo Shou." Perhaps Xu never saw "Mo Shou," so he interpreted it literally. A late Song author's work (formerly attributed to Zheng Qiao, following the "Siku Tiyao" theory) "Six Classics Profound Discussions · Spring and Autumn Classic · Three Commentaries" says: "Those who revere Gongyang take Gongyang as ink defense, and take Zuoshi and Guliang as vital spots and chronic illness."[3] This probably also follows the same error.

I believe that works in the category of classical studies history, like Meng's "Jingxue Jueyuan" (Origins of Classical Studies), can be called refined. But comparing this book with Meng's work reveals that this book can hardly be called refined. Nevertheless, this book has clear organization and detailed citations, and can serve as a reference for those reading the Spring and Autumn.
