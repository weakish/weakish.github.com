Shath'Yar Language
==================

## Grammar

All example sentences in this section use official translations.

The apostrophe (`'`) functions as a hyphen, one usage being to form modifier-head compound words.
For example, *shath* (old) combined with *yar* (god) forms *shath'yar*, meaning "old gods," and also refers to the language used by the old gods.
Similarly, *Shuul'wah* = Deathwing.

### Case System

The language shows nominative, accusative, and possessive cases:

- Y'za noq mah... Y'za noq ormz... = I am not (the) first... I am not (the) last...
- Sk'magg yawifk hoq. = Your suffering strengthens me.
- Uulwi ifis halahs gag erh'ongg w'ssh. = (The) shadow (of) my corpse will choke (this) land for all eternity.

Like English, the second person nominative and accusative have the same form (iilth):

- Iilth ma paf'qi'ag sk'halahs. =  You are a prisoner (in) your own body.
- N'Zoth ga zyqtahg iilth. = The will of N'Zoth corrupts you.

When used as subject, possessive and noun are connected with `'`, when used as object the possessive and noun are directly connected:

- Sk'shgn eqnizz hoq. = Your fear drives me.
- Ywaq puul skshgn. = They drink your fear.

The first person plural nominative and possessive, and the possessive forms of first person plural and second person are quite regular:

- Ag'THYZAK agthu. = We RECLAIM (this) world!
- Ak'agthshi ma uhnish. = Our numbers are endless.
- Sk'uuyat guulphg hoq. = Your agony sustains me.

But the second person nominative is iilth, accusative is ilfah (or original form).
This may reflect the historical evolution of Shath-Yar language, just like in English the second person nominative and accusative were originally different (thou/ye, thee/you), but later unified.

- Iilth ma paf'qi'ag sk'halahs. GAZ SKSHGN! = You are a prisoner in your own body. A SERVANT OF FEAR!
- N'Zoth ga zyqtahg iilth. = (The) will (of) N'Zoth corrupts you.
- Ez, Shuul'wah! Sk'woth'gl yu'gaz yog'ghyl ilfah! = O, Deathwing! Your faithful servant has failed you!

### Verbal System

*ma* corresponds to "are" or auxiliary "do," with negative form *maq*:

- Ak'agthshi ma uhnish. = Our numbers are endless.
- Iilth ma paf'qi'ag sk'halahs. GAZ SKSHGN! = You are (a) prisoner (in) your (own) body. (A) SERVANT (OF) FEAR!
- Ywaq maq oou; ywaq maq ssaggh. Ywaq ma shg'fhn. = They do not die; they do not live. They are outside (the) cycle.

*ma* is probably not used for first person, at least *noq* corresponds to am not (guessing noq's original form is no):

- Y'za noq mah... Y'za noq ormz... = I am not (the) first... I am not (the) last...

*ma* is not used for third person singular, third person singular uses *al*:

- Yoq'al shn ky ywaq nuul. = It is (the) perpetuity in (which) they dwell. (shn = in)

The future tense of ma is qi:

- Iilth qi mah'shar fhn oorql N'Zoth! = You will be (the) first (of) many (to) glimpse (the) madness (of) N'Zoth!
- Sk'yahf qi'plahf PH'MAGG! = Your soul will know ENDLESS TORMENT!
- Ilith qi'uothk shn'ma yeh'glu Shath'Yar! = You will drown in (the) blood (of the) Old Gods!

We already mentioned shn means in, shn'ma here probably derives from sha, with similar meaning, possibly underneath.

gag can also be used to express future tense:

- H'iwn iggksh Phquathi gag OOU KAAXTH SHUUL! = All (who) oppose the Destroyer will DIE A THOUSAND DEATHS!

The noun form of gag is ga:

N'Zoth ga zyqtahg iilth. = The will of N'Zoth corrupts you.

agth means shall:

- Sk'shuul agth vorzz N'Zoth naggwa'fssh. = Your deaths shall sing of N'Zoth's unending glory.
- Iilth vwah, uhn'agth fhssh za. = Where one falls, many shall take its place.

The second example sentence literally translates to: You fall, many shall take place.

sythn indicates progressive tense:

- Iilth sythn aqev... aqev... aqev... = You are going mad... mad... mad...
- Yeh'glu N'Zoth okom hoq... Y'za sythn oou... = (The) blood (of) N'Zoth runs through me... I cannot die...

In the second example, Y'za sythn oou literally translates to I am dying.
Undead constantly decay, constantly approaching death, can be said to be undying, or can be said to be dying.

Questions are like English, moving the verb forward:

- Al'ksh syq iir awan? = Is this real or (an) illusion?

an as prefix, written together with nouns, means into:

- Gul'kafh an'shel. = Gaze into (the) void.
- Gul'kafh an'qov N'Zoth. = Gaze into (the) heart (of) N'Zoth.

## Exercises

Translation:

Q1:

> Light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.

-- Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita

Q2:

> May the force be with you.

-- Star Wars

Q3:

> See you soon.

Q4:

> Hello world!

A1: These vocabulary are unknown: fire, loin, sin, can use synonyms instead: fire/fssh (glory), loin/qornaus (endless hunger), sin/uull(darkness).

    Razzqi ifis zuq, fssh ifis qornaus. Ifis uull. Ifis yahf.

    Of course the alliteration of the original text cannot be preserved.

A2: Similarly, use synonyms to replace unknown vocabulary.

    Agth uq eqnizz ilfah.

    That is, Shall (the) power drive you. The semantics are actually quite distant from the original text, but I can't think of a better translation.

A3: soon is unknown, translate the synonymous sentence see you again.

    Kyth ilfah ye.

A4: Ez, agthu!
