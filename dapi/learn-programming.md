# Programming Learning Path

## Path One

First, learn English well. High school level is sufficient.
High school English covers basically all the grammar, with a vocabulary of 3500 words - even with a discount, 3000 words is more than enough.
Learning to this level is sufficient. Later, through extensive reading of English materials, computing-related vocabulary will naturally accumulate - no need to deliberately memorize them in advance.

Actually, middle school level English with a vocabulary of 1500 words is barely enough.
The problem with middle school English is that some grammar hasn't been covered, meaning you might encounter unfamiliar structures.
Fortunately, in many cases, even without understanding the structure, you can infer meaning from context.
And after seeing similar structures frequently, you might gradually understand them.
Chinese grammar is typically formally introduced at the undergraduate level, but this doesn't prevent people from using Chinese before then.
Although non-native languages are much more difficult, it's the same principle.
When looking up bilingual dictionaries in middle school, the dictionary explanations extensively used relative clauses. At the time I had no idea what relative clauses were,
but gradually I could understand the function of this structure.

As the saying goes, sharpening the axe doesn't delay chopping wood. But there's no need to be too deliberate about sharpening the axe to just the right degree.
If you over-sharpen and learn too much English, you can go into translation.
High school level English is only sufficient for reading - translation requires much more. Forcing translation easily creates pitfalls for others, though it's fine as personal practice.
If you feel your enthusiasm for learning programming is being worn away during the "sharpening" process, you can set it aside for now and go directly to learning. It's the same to supplement it later when necessary.
Answers are not as important as questions; path is not as important as motivation and interest.

Next, read an introductory book.

Which one to choose? At this stage you basically know nothing about programming, so how do you judge whether a book is good or bad?

Actually, there is a way.

Look at the thickness of the book.

This superficial judgment method is surprisingly useful.
The reasoning behind it is that if an introductory book is not thin enough:

1. Either the book introduces too many details - introductory books should introduce the essence of the field, not let beginners get lost in details;
2. Or the book includes content that's too advanced for an introductory book;
3. Or the book treats readers as idiots, doesn't trust readers' abilities - many books give you screenshots for every step, making the book look very thick but actually saying nothing substantial;
4. Or the author just randomly cobbled together a book without knowing what they're doing.

I recommend The Little Schemer.
If this book is hard to find, or if you feel it doesn't suit your taste, picking another introductory book is the same. Just remember to choose a thin one.

## Path Two

Don't learn English, directly read the Chinese translation of The Little Schemer.

Note: I haven't read the Chinese translation, so I don't know the quality of the translation.

Or you could read SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) translated by Qiu Zongyan.
This book is not thin. However, for introduction purposes, you only need to read the first 3 chapters, which makes it relatively thin.
Unlike The Little Schemer, SICP has many exercises.
If you find it challenging, you can do them selectively or simply skip them. Exercises are originally prepared for those who have energy to spare - don't let exercises damage your confidence.

## Path Three

Create your own path.

You often understand yourself better than others do, so the path you create for yourself might be more suitable than paths recommended by others.
Don't be afraid to explore. As long as you maintain motivation and interest, you'll always find a way through - at worst you'll take some detours.
Even if taking detours slows your progress a bit, being able to blaze your own unique trail will give you confidence.
The experience of independently exploring in darkness will also give you a certain feeling.

Few people have the fortune or misfortune to always walk along others' paths.
Someday you'll encounter situations where no one has explored the path before. At that time, the confidence and feeling from your initial experience will become your aid.
