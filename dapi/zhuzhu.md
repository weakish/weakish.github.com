In the early days of Taobao around 200X, a large number of .cn websites had Taobao pop-up ads, which were extremely annoying.
After a few years, they disappeared. Now Alipay's support for Linux and Mac OS X is also much better than it was a few years ago.
So I had an illusion: when a company gets big, it will follow some rules. Now I see this was really just an illusion. :-()
