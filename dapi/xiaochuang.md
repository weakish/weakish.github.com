# Postscript on "Casual Discussion of Spirit Seats and Spirit Beds from the Two Jin to Tang Dynasties"

Regarding the size of spirit beds, "Casual Discussion of Spirit Seats and Spirit Beds from the Two Jin to Tang Dynasties" cites the "five-chi bed" from "Song Shu · Wang Wei Biography," arguing that a five-chi bed would be difficult to use as bedding, and also cites "Chen Shu · Yao Cha Biography" and "Xie Zhen Biography" using "small bed" as spirit bed.

Investigation: "Liang Shu" Volume 52 states "on the first and fifteenth days and anniversary dates, a small bed may be temporarily arranged," also using small bed as spirit bed. Moreover, small beds before the Tang dynasty were not bedding either. "Bei Shi" Volume 48 mentions "sitting facing south on a small bed northwest of the imperial bed," "Jiu Tang Shu" Volume 186 mentions "each sitting upright on small beds," and "Yu Lan" Volume 393 cites "Jin Zhongxing Shu" saying that Tao Dan "set up a small bed to sit alone, not sharing with others" - all are evidence of this. (After the Song dynasty, small beds mostly referred to bedding.) However, the "five-chi bed" in "Song Shu" and the "small beds" in "Chen Shu" and "Liang Shu" were all used by biography subjects who valued frugality, so ordinary ritual practice may not have exclusively used small beds as spirit beds. For example, "Wen Xuan" by Lu Ji's "Eulogy for Emperor Wu of Wei" states that Emperor Wu of Wei's "Last Will" used an "eight-chi bed" ("Yu Lan" and "Lei Ju" cite it as "six-chi bed," probably a scribal error. Song dynasty Zhao Rusui's "Yegu Poetry Manuscript · Bronze Sparrow Platform Elegy" says "bright moon shines empty on the eight-chi bed," also using "eight-chi") as a spirit bed.
