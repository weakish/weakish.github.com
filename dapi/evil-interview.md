Devil King Interview Record
===========================

Recently, due to a special opportunity, I was fortunate enough to visit the devil's lair. Taking advantage of this rare chance, I conducted an interview with the Devil King.

Me: Your Majesty the Devil King, do you have time for an interview?

Devil King: Sure. But as an exchange, after the interview you must answer three questions from me. If your answers aren't sincere, then you'll have to stay here to improve my meals.

Me: Deal. Have you heard about the recent "Devil King burns Princess" incident? Modern devil kings seem quite innovative. Since he couldn't win the princess's heart, he simply burned her to death. The most important part of ownership is the right of disposal, right? In this sense, isn't taking the princess's life the ultimate way of possession? The modern devil king seems to have achieved total victory. As a traditional devil king who stays in the lair all day, what do you have to say about this?

Devil King: Trash who can't even burn a person to death - does he deserve to be called a devil king?

Me: Although she didn't die, this doesn't affect the big picture. With the princess burned like this, probably few princes will be interested in her in the future, right? Moreover, regardless of whether the princess can still win princes' favor in the future, she probably won't be able to escape the devil king's shadow for her entire life. Think about the princess's future - studying, working, dating, marriage, raising children - all constantly affected by this incident. Think about it: every time she washes her hair, every time water flows unobstructed from her head down her face to her chin, the princess realizes once again that she's lost one ear. No matter how much she hates that devil king, she cannot deny that he changed her entire life. Probably few people could have such a deep and lasting impact on her life like that evil devil king, right? In a sense, regardless of the devil king's fate, he will remain as an indelible shadow accompanying the princess for life.

Devil King: Stop babbling - I almost thought you came to sell gasoline and lighters. Ask your question.

Me: My confusion is: why do devil kings generation after generation stubbornly kidnap princesses, then let princes come to their door to kill them, letting princes take the unharmed princess back and achieve fame and marriage for free? Since they can become devil kings, they can't be stupid, right? Even teenagers could think of better ideas - devil kings have no reason not to think of them, right? Even if one devil king didn't think of it, surely not all devil kings would fail to think of it? What's the real story behind this?

Devil King: That's why I say that guy isn't a devil king. Being unable to burn someone to death is secondary - most importantly, burning a princess is something only humans would think of. The moment he lit the fire, he declared his own failure. He knew the princess's heart didn't hold him, he had no chance of winning her heart, so he could only influence her life this way. But a devil king never truly despairs - a devil king always believes that the princess deeply loves him.

Me: The princess deeply loves the devil king? The stories never say that.

Devil King: That's because you haven't read carefully! Think about it: the princess grew up in the royal palace, knowing from childhood that she would marry a prince and that devil kings are evil. How much independent thinking can you expect from her? That's why we devil kings take princesses to remote lairs - there are no worldly distractions here, perfect for the princess to contemplate her life in this tranquil environment, question her heart, and break free from conventional prejudices. Given time, the princess will surely realize that worldly bias has blinded her true heart - what she actually likes is the devil king.

Me: I see. Then why haven't we heard of any princess having this great awakening?

Devil King: How dare you question me? In most cases, those princes arrive too quickly - the princess doesn't have enough time to think clearly. Also, once a princess finally goes with a devil king, the royal family would surely keep it secret as a great scandal - would they really make it into stories and spread it everywhere?

Me: Ah, so family scandals aren't aired publicly. Haven't any media outlets broken the story?

Devil King: Would media targeting humans as customers dare to position themselves as anti-human?

Me: That's true. Maybe quite a few princes have been killed by devil kings, but the media just doesn't report it.

Devil King: Not really. Devil kings have a major weakness when fighting princes. So in battles between devil kings and princes, they usually lose more than win.

Me: Oh? What weakness?

Devil King: Because they fear the princess will be heartbroken, unless absolutely necessary, devil kings don't really want to kill, often holding back, hoping only to wound or repel rather than take the prince's life. Also, life-and-death moments are perfect opportunities to recognize one's true heart. So many devil kings deliberately put themselves in potentially destructive crises during battle, hoping that in that moment, the princess will realize that when the devil king and prince are fighting to the death, she initially wants the prince to win, but when the devil king is truly about to die, she secretly hopes he won't die. This is extremely dangerous, because princes brave enough to come to devil lairs won't be weak. But the opportunity of life-and-death moments is too precious - few devil kings can resist this fatal temptation.

Me: So devil kings suffer all these hidden disadvantages when fighting princes. Really, devil kings used to be so carefree, but they became so constrained just because they like princesses?

The Devil King, who had been answering my questions casually, spoke seriously: Falling in love with the princess is the devil king's destiny.

Me: Isn't there any devil king who can escape this destiny?

The Devil King thought for a moment and said: There was once an exception. There was a devil king who never kidnapped a princess. Until the day before the prince and princess's wedding, he suddenly appeared and took the princess away. The prince caught up and killed the devil king. The prince and princess discovered that the devil king's lair had already been decorated for a wedding, and even better than the palace decorations, so they simply gathered everyone and held the wedding in the devil's lair.

Me: So he still didn't escape destiny in the end.

Devil King: No, he didn't love the princess - he loved the prince. He originally planned to stay in his lair forever, not disturbing the prince and princess's happy life. But on the day before the prince's wedding, he couldn't help but go take a look. He happened to hear the princess complaining to the prince that the wedding decorations weren't good enough, with the prince constantly apologizing. Seeing his beloved apologizing broke the devil king's heart. But he couldn't help, because the prince wouldn't accept a devil king's assistance. So he simply kidnapped the princess and decorated his lair for the wedding. With the devil king's powerful magic, the wedding arrangements naturally couldn't be compared to an earthly palace. Then came the battle with his beloved. Originally the devil king hoped to keep fighting like this forever, but later the prince's strength gradually failed. The devil king worried that the prince's strength wouldn't hold up and the princess would complain on their wedding night, so he deliberately showed an opening. Thus the exhausted, already desperate prince pierced the devil king's chest with his sword. The joy of escaping death, the happiness of achieving fame, the pleasure of the approaching wedding - all intertwined, and the prince's face showed a genuine smile. Looking at the prince's smiling face, that devil king was happiest in that moment: "I'm afraid you weren't even this happy when you learned you could inherit the throne or when the princess agreed to your proposal. Your greatest joy in life was brought by me. Right at this moment. And your smile has also warmed my heart. My greatest warmth in life was brought by you. Also right at this moment."

I was immersed in this touching story and didn't come back to my senses for a long time. Suddenly the Devil King said: Your turn. Answer my three questions! Seeing your enchanted expression, I'm quite curious about your sexual orientation. Tell me, what is your sexual orientation?

I thought for a moment and answered: Every man had thought that he loved women, until he met his superman.

This was a skillful answer. First, it was sincere and didn't violate our agreement. Second, it actually said nothing. On the surface it seemed to say I was gay, but I might not be, because I might not have met my superman yet. Of course the Devil King might not be so easily fooled and might ask whether I'd actually met him. But then he'd have used up another questioning opportunity, greatly increasing my chances of leaving safely.

Who knew the Devil King didn't dwell on it much and asked an unrelated question: What kind of toilet paper do you use after defecating?

I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking this devil king was just a bit sleazy and gossipy, shouldn't be hard to handle. I answered this question truthfully.

Facts proved the Devil King wasn't such a simple character. This question was just to make me think I'd passed and develop contempt.

The Devil King said slowly: Hmm, I know this paper. Although it's labeled as toilet paper in supermarkets, it's actually as soft as some facial tissues. Now, the last question: have you ever thought that the man might not care at all about your carefully tended chrysanthemum?

My back was covered in cold sweat, but I still shouted with all my might: Then have you ever thought that maybe the princess doesn't like the devil king at all? That the so-called princess actually liking the devil king, just that her true heart is obscured and she hasn't realized it herself - maybe it's all just the devil king's wishful thinking?

Devil King: A counter-question isn't an answer! Tonight I can drink pork rib soup.

Only then did I realize that in my panic, I'd forgotten to answer the question. But I wasn't willing to die like this, so I argued: You're just flustered because I exposed the truth, right? Some devil king you are! No cultivation at all!

Devil King: The one who's flustered is you. Let me make it clear before you die, though I have no obligation to tell you. Your counter-question was just evasion - you don't have the courage to face this question sincerely. I deeply believe the princess actually likes me, though she hasn't realized it herself, because I am a devil king. I have the dignity and pride of being a devil king. You're not a devil king, so what makes you so sure that the man you love also loves you?

I closed my eyes in complete despair. The Devil King was right - I feared this question, I dared not face it, I hadn't answered sincerely, so I would pay the price.

While waiting for death, unconsciously, I thought again of that man who haunts my dreams. What is he doing right now? For no reason, I seemed to see him watching me not far away. I thought, others would only think I died at the devil king's hands - who would know I actually died under that person's gaze? To die under his gaze would also be a kind of happiness.

Then the Devil King sighed: I think you know the answer now. Say it.

I didn't open my eyes, but said softly: When I close my eyes, I can feel that man's gaze upon me is so tender. In that moment, I know he loves me.

Only after speaking did I realize - I had answered, I didn't have to die. But I was also puzzled: why did the Devil King remind me? If he hadn't reminded me, I would have forgotten the question and agreement completely - I wouldn't have thought to answer on my own.

The Devil King saw my puzzled look and guessed my thoughts: When you first arrived, your soul was filled with sadness, anxiety, unwillingness, despair, doubt and other emotions. Such a soul aroused my appetite, so I accompanied you in this interview - I just wanted to use the opportunity to devour you. But just now your soul was very peaceful, which is tasteless to me. So I reminded you - generally speaking, when someone is in a must-die mindset and suddenly learns they already know the answer and can be saved by speaking it, they feel joy at escaping death. I planned to swallow you whole at that moment when you wanted to speak but hadn't yet - though it would be hasty, it would still have some flavor. Who knew you'd have no emotional fluctuation at all.

Me: I don't think I can maintain this peaceful mindset for long.

Devil King: But you've already sincerely answered my three questions. According to our agreement, I can only send you back.

So I escaped the devil's lair and returned to this beautiful real world that some say is even more dangerous than the devil's lair.
