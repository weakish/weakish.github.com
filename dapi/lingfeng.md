# "Lingfeng's Love Story and Kendo Club": The Literary Pursuit of "Writing with Feeling" - A Grammar-Centered Analysis

Abstract
----

This paper analyzes the grammatical features of Hatsune's "Lingfeng's Love Story and Kendo Club" in the "Introduction," "Prologue," and "Chapter One," revealing the literary pursuit of "writing with feeling" behind the special usage of "feeling" (感觉) and "you" (你).

Introduction
------

> Lingfeng is the president of the kendo club,
> He also has a younger sister at home, who is Tianyi, you are the sister and a chef,

Using "you" (你) to refer to previously mentioned characters, treating it as words the "I" (author) says to the referenced character, namely "Tianyi, you are the sister and a chef." Here "I" is the author. "Tianyi is the sister and a chef" is just ordinary narration, while "you are the sister and a chef" emphasizes that "sister" and "chef" are the author's character settings, while giving the feeling that the author is actively creating these settings. This usage manifests strong fictional coloring, making readers feel as if they are witnessing the author assigning character traits in real time. As the author countered a reader's comment "Frankly speaking, this language disorder is quite severe" by saying "I am writing literary works."

Note: "has a younger sister, who is Tianyi" uses "is" (是) to separate appositive elements. Similarly, in "Chapter One," "the weather is sunny and bright" separates subject and predicate. (This explanation marked with "Note:" helps understand quotations but is unrelated to the main topic.)

> Lingfeng has four club members: Xiaolin, Xiaohai, Xiaobing, and Brother Hui who is the vice president of the kendo club, are you friends who competed together in the tournament?

Here "you" (你) refers to "Lingfeng," highlighting that the author has given the protagonist a friend.

Note: The "is" (是) here still separates the appositive "Brother Hui" and "vice president of the kendo club." The "ma" (吗) is a modal particle that doesn't indicate a question but rather declarative mood.

> Lingfeng likes a female classmate at school, you are called Mirai, whom he likes in his class.

Here "you" (你) refers to the female classmate, and "whom he likes in his class" supplements the explanation of "at school."
Note that here "Mirai" uses "you," while the previous sentence didn't use "you."
"Lingfeng, you like a female classmate at school" would emphasize that Lingfeng liking female classmates is the author's setting,
but the author doesn't want to emphasize this point, so "you" isn't used.
In other words, although the author likes using "you" to highlight fictionality,
since Lingfeng is the main protagonist, the author has projected himself into the character, as the author himself said "Lingfeng's feelings are my feelings."
Therefore, he doesn't want Lingfeng's emotions to feel fictional.
Comparing with the previous mentions of Tianyi and Brother Hui, we can see that sister and friend are just settings, not what the author cares most about.


Chapter One
-----

> ... Mirai felt everyone seemed to want to sit with me "Help me, can we not have so many people sitting together,"


"Feeling" (感觉) introduces the subject's psychological activity. Quotation marks are used to identify inner monologue within psychological activity.

Note: "Mirai" (未来) is the female protagonist's name. "Help me, can we not have so many people sitting together" demonstrates ellipsis that differs from usual grammar.

> She felt (felt) seeing a male student "really so handsome" "teacher what is your name,"

The first "feeling" (感觉) introduces the subject's psychological activity, the second "feeling" (感觉) emphasizes it is a subjective feeling.
It appears repetitive on the surface, but actually isn't repetitive.

Here "you" (你) refers to the male student she sees (actually the male protagonist), not the teacher.
Here in "(handsome male student) what is your name," the "I" is not the author himself, but the female protagonist "Mirai."
The female protagonist would actually say "teacher, what is his name" to avoid the teacher mistaking that she's asking about the teacher's own name,
but in the text it's written as "you," this grammar reflects that although the female protagonist appears to be asking the teacher on the surface, she's actually having a "dialogue" with the male protagonist in her heart.

These two grammatical features both highlight psychological activity. As the author himself said "I write out all the psychological aspects."

Of course, there's another possible valid explanation: the female protagonist actually also says "teacher, what is your name,"
which might cause misunderstanding in reality, but since both the female protagonist and teacher are fictional characters created by the author, they naturally know what the other is saying.
Using "you" to refer to the male protagonist still reflects that the female protagonist is having a "dialogue" with the male protagonist in her heart.

> The teacher felt "who are you talking about,"

Here the quotation marks identify spoken words, and the preceding "feeling" (感觉) indicates this is exactly what the teacher thinks,
in other words, it's spoken inner monologue.
With the teacher as subject, in dialogue with Mirai, naturally "you" is used from the teacher's perspective.
This consistency shows that what the teacher says aloud and his inner speech are consistent.

> Mirai felt she didn't know what I was saying "I'll point it out for you," so she pointed over, the teacher felt seeing Mirai's finger, he knew who it was

Here "feeling" (感觉) emphasizes that "seeing Mirai's finger, he knew who it was" is the teacher's thought

> The teacher felt "do you really want to sit together with Lingfeng," Mirai felt "no, I just want to know your name"
> The teacher felt seeing there really weren't many seats, so he said: "No way, you're really handsome,"

Here "you" (你) still refers to the male protagonist, indicating that the teacher also genuinely thinks the male protagonist is handsome, speaking to the female protagonist on the surface but speaking to the male protagonist in his heart.

Note: "No way" (不要啊) omits "don't want to sit together with Lingfeng."

> ... Mirai felt like writing a love confession, because I want to confess to Suzuki on stage,
> you write out the song title, and continue writing lyrics.

Here "you" (你) emphasizes the author is making character settings.
The previous sentence uses "I" to highlight that the confession is Mirai's own will (not wanting to emphasize here that the female protagonist liking the male protagonist is the author's setting),
since songwriting is closely related to character design, "you" is used.

Similar examples include the first sentence of the "Prologue":

> Lingfeng felt "My name is Lingfeng, I'm a first-year student, and also an old classmate at school"
> Lingfeng felt that no female classmate at school knows you have a muscular body and Taiwanese facial features,
> in front of you girls, I am a male god "really so handsome," and I don't know how many female classmates have fallen for me,

Here muscular body and Taiwanese facial features use "you" to highlight they are character settings.
"In front of you girls, I am a male god" and "don't know how many female classmates have fallen for me" similarly don't want to highlight that being a male god is the author's setting.
"First-year student, and also an old classmate at school" was originally a setting, but because it follows "My name is Lingfeng," it also doesn't use "you,"
making it more like inner monologue self-introduction. Names are closely related to individuals, for example "Zhang San" gives a fictional feeling, so "you" isn't used.

As mentioned before, not wanting to use "you" to highlight fictionality is to avoid affecting immersion.
Actually, this grammar also serves to distinguish immersible parts from hard-to-immerse parts.
Many male readers would immerse themselves in "male god," "don't know how many female classmates have fallen for me," fewer would immerse in "muscular body," and very few in "Taiwanese facial features."


Conclusion
----

Many of the unique grammatical features in "Lingfeng's Love Story and Kendo Club" are just the author's habits, for example the author says in comments (close to everyday language) "classmates at school, told me they don't like to talk," where normal habit would pause after "at school," but the author pauses after "classmates," showing the author habitually considers the subject and predicate to be far apart, and using "is" (是) to separate subject and predicate in the work reflects this habit of the author.

But using "feeling" (感觉) to introduce psychological activity, using "you" (你) to show characters' inner speech, reflects the author's emphasis on describing the "psychological aspects."
Using "you" to reflect the fictionality of character settings, serving to distinguish immersible from hard-to-immerse components, can be seen as describing readers' "psychological aspects."

The author proposed literary criticism of Japanese light novels when replying to reader comments on "Lingfeng's Love Story and Kendo Club":

> When I first started reading Japanese light novels, what did I read,
> I used three methods, the first was seeing, the second was thinking, the third was feeling.
> Using these three methods to read, I discovered that Japanese light novels are light novels written with feeling.

Regardless of whether this critical view is reasonable, it at least shows that "writing with feeling" is the author's literary creative pursuit, and "reading with feeling" is the reading method the author endorses.

Using "feeling" (感觉) to introduce psychological activity, using "you" (你) to show characters' inner speech, emphasizing description of characters' "psychological aspects," reflects the author's literary creative pursuit of "writing with feeling"; using "you" to reflect the fictionality of character settings, serving to distinguish immersible from hard-to-immerse components, can be seen as describing readers' "psychological aspects," which is the author's literary creative attempt to encourage readers to "read with feeling," echoing "writing with feeling."
