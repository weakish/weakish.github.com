I used to have a `git switch` alias pointed to `legit switch`, and haven't checked the native switch command introduced by recent versions of git till today.

Reading `git help switch` got me very confused.
Then after some googling, I understood that basically git switch is just git checkout.

It turns out that in `git checkout foo`, `foo` can mean a branch or a file.
And if both branch foo and file foo exist, the branch takes priority.
Recent versions of git introduces `switch` and `restore` to offer a cleaner user interface.

Initially I got confused because I never knew `git checkout path` till today.
I always did `git checkout rev path` before.

Conclusion: git sucks.

A Survey on Social Networks

- [FSF] is cautious on social networks:

    - Gnu Social (former StatusNet)

    - Mastodon

    - PeerTube

    - Twitter

        FSF uses a custom script to post to their GNU social, Mastodon,
        and Twitter accounts simultaneously.
        This avoids using the nonfree JS of the Twitter website.
        Choqok, a KDE application which supports Twitter and GNU Social,
        is used to view replies and retweet posts.
        Unlike Facebook, FSF have no ethical objection
        to **merely** having an account on Twitter.

- [EFF] tends to reach for more people:

    - Twitter
    - Facebook
    - Instagram
    - YouTube
    - Flickr

- [Debian] hosts a micronews site (a static site generated via pelican),
  and the feed is automatically syndicated to these non-official accounts:

    - Mastodon & GNU Social

        Since both use the ActivityPub protocol,
        the non-official Debian Mastodon account can be subscribed from
        GNU Social.

    - Twitter

        Besides the non-official @debian, @debconf, @planetdebian
        accounts, several Debian teams have accounts on Twitter.

    - Facebook

    - LinkedIn

    - Hacker News

- [Gentoo] seemingly chooses the most popular social networks:

    - Twitter

    - Facebook

- Python, Slackware, FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc.

    They just do not care about social networks.

Summary

- Host content on your own site, optionally syndicate to social networks.
- Use distributed social networks such as Mastodon.
- Twitter is an acceptable choice among popular social networks.

Stacked encryption systems

tl;dr

- Compared to block level encryption or file system native encryption,
stacked encrypted files can be easily backed up via popular cloud
storage services such as DropBox.
- Use cryfs for sensitive data.
- Use gocryptfs in reverse mode for other data if the cloud storage does
not support end to end encryption itself.

Comparison:

- ecryptfs

    - pros: mature, merged in Linux kernel
    - cons: Linux only
    - cons: no protection over meta data such as file numbers or file
    sizes

- gocryptfs

    - pros: also offers a [reverse mode], which can be used to backup
    files on a block encrypted disk (e.g. LUKS) to a cloud storage
    (e.g. DropBox)
    - pros: fastest in performance among stacked encryption solutions
    - pros: available under Linux and macOS, with third party Windows
    and Android port
    - cons: no protection over meta data
    - cons: [weaker integrity protection][threat model]

- cryfs

    - pros: meta data protected via chunked storage
    - pros: support Linux, macOS, and Windows (experimental)
    - pros: included in [slackware 15]
    - cons: significant speed and size overhead

Just tried installing EndeavourOS on a virtual machine.

The Caramares installer can configure LUKS full disk encryption
automatically. However, when booting the freshly installed system,
I can only type the encryption passphrase in US qwerty keyboard layout.

[frostschutz] suggests a workaround:

> add the passphrase twice. So the same sequence of key presses will be accepted
> in both US/qwerty layout and whatever you usually use (in my case, DE/qwertz).

[frostschutz]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/174657

Inspired from frostschutz, I configured the installation with qwerty
layout. When I input the passphrase for LUKS encryption, I just input
the sequence of key presses as the same if I were on a dvorak layout.

When setting up the user password during the installation, I input a
temporary password containing only numbers.

After booting into the installed system, I changed the user password and
the keyboard layout.

until recently I became interested in text processors
and learned that most of them do not support Dvorak layout.

I decided to take notes as git commit messages.

Why?

- It is distributed by nature. I do not need to rely on a central
service.

- I am familiar with git. Most of the time I take notes under the
terminal, where I aliased `n` to `git commit --allow-empty`. And if
necessary, I can write commit messages via GitHub web UI or GitHub
mobile application.

- GitHub provides ATOM feed for recent commits out of the box:

    ```
    https://github.com/weakish/USER/REPO/master.atom
    ```

- Since I wrote commit messages in Markdown format. It is trivial to
generate a static html page:

    ```sh
    git log | sed -r 's/^((commit |Author: |Date: ).+)/\1<br>/g' |
    sed -r 's/^[ ]{4}//g' > log.md
    ```

    Once I got the Markdown file, I can put it under almost any static
    site generator.

- I may use branches for notes in different languages or categories in
future.

Pop!_OS advertises itself as a developer friendly Linux distribution. However, it uses flatpak, whose sandbox system has a lot of issues with IDEs and editors (they typically need to access system commands and files).

Personally I prefer AppImage. It solves the "with dependencies packaged in and run on any Linux distributions" problem in a simple way and does not rely on  a centric distribution channel. If I want to use AppImage packaged programs in sandbox, I can use firejail. "Do one thing and do it well." AppImage respects the old unix philosophy.

Fedora Silverblue uses [OSTree] for its base system, and it is the most mature distribution with an OSTree based base system.

Since the base system is immutable, new software are installed via Flatpak (sandboxed GUI applications with all its dependencies packaged in) or toolbox (command line programs running inside docker like containers). There are a few exceptions (shell, drivers, etc.) need to be installed via layered rpm packages, which require a reboot.

[OSTree]: https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/

I think this is a cool idea. However, I am still unsure whether it is worth to trade in extra disk space and incompatibilities with some software for the confidence that I can  rollback to a usable base system quickly (just reboot) anytime (not require a Internet connection).

[Pop!_OS][pop] is a Ubuntu based distribution which features:

- A tiling extension for gnome shell (I am a happy i3 user and if you really want to use GNOME, you can install this extension yourself on Ubuntu).
- Flatpak (Although Ubuntu have snap preinstalled, you can still use Flatpak on Ubuntu, just as on most other Linux distributions).
- Automatic full-disk encryption during installation. (I'm astonished that Ubuntu still requires manual setup to enable full-disk encryption during installation in 2020. But to be honest, manual setup is not hard.)

So nothing exciting here. But to be fair, "just works out of the box" is a big feature. Particularly, out of the box full-disk encryption is very important for inexperienced users to adapt it.

Pop!_OS is what Ubuntu should have been.

JAMStack is another buzzword targeting clients using LAMP stack (e.g. wordpress) to host their website. Static website generator will not work because it will confuse those clients: "Static website? Our site was static N years ago and we use FTP to upload those static web pages to the server. Didn't you told us that static website is outdated with limited features? Why go back to a static site?"

Q: Why I do not have faith in God?

A: As Larry Wall paraphrased, faith is just two bits away:

> 1. God exists, and
> 2. God is good to people who really look for him

I am not able to prove the first bit is true but let me just assume the first bit is true.

The second bit is I have to really look for the God. Jesus said you only have to have faith the size of a mustard seed. But no matter how small the size of the faith is, it is **still an opt-in option**. If God is really good, then why faith is **not an opt-out option**?

Because we are sinners. And the sensible default option for sinners is no faith and going to hell. Salvation is a **gift** from the God.

However, **a gift is something declinable by its very definition**. Thus I can choose to **decline this gift and keep on the default option**. I did so.

Although I do not have faith in God, I am still grateful to God. **Thank God for allowing such a sinner as I to have the free will to decline his gift**.

And what if the first bit is not true? Then I would like to thank god for being nonexistent.

First impression on [hey email][hey]:

1. I cannot write an email in plain text. There are no options in settings. All emails are HTML.
2. To organize in emails in "Imbox"/"The Feed"/"Paper Trail", I have to manually classify them, or set up that all mails from a certain address go to one of these categories. I expected there will be something fancy magic based on the so called machine learning here, but there is not. And at least in Gmail I can create filters based on more conditions (e.g. subject or body content).
3. I can select text in email and click "save clips". But they are only shown in the clips menu, there is no highlight in the original email. And in the clips page, I cannot click the clipped text to go to the exact position of the original email (I can only go to the beginning of the email). Therefore context is lost during clipping.
4. I do not think a dedicated new mail services is necessary to implement most of the UX features hey offered.

Recently I watched [Openbook 2019 talk by Audrey Tang on YouTube][talk]. The talk is given in Chinese and here is some notes I have taken.

[talk]: https://youtu.be/fzLz3LBMHz4

## Assistant Intelligence

Audrey regards AI as Assistant Intelligence instead of Artificial Intelligence.

## Reading

Audrey finds the following reading methods help her to understand the content:

1. Translation or abstract translation.
2. Taking notes and doodling with pens.

When not having a pen at hand, Audrey will scan the book or pdf quickly (about 0.2s per page). Then she will rest for a while, maybe drinking some tea, and "review" those pages in mind with her eyes closed. If something occurred to her, she will note them down.

When having a lot of materials to read, she will quickly scan them before sleep, and absorb them in sleep. She found out an 8 hour sleep can absorb around 400 pages of material.

Audrey did most of her reading  on an iPad Pro (with a pen).
She uses the kindle app for iPad, but she converts all books she bought from different channels using calibre.

## Emoji as a universal language

Audrey thinks emoji is a more universal language than English.

However, I think while it is cool to [making slides in pictures and emoji][emoji-slide]. It is difficult to express complex ideas only with emoji. For example, can you [guess what these slides mean][guess]?

[emoji-slide]: https://speakerdeck.com/audreyt/reinventing-democracy
[guess]: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Reinventing-Democracy-EbWGsC1m7MTUqaxNNAmdC

## Humor over Rumor

Audrey introduces the disinformation definition in Taiwan: intentional harmful untruth (harmful to the public). To counter disinformation, clarification need to take a humorous form, to become a meme spreading faster and wider than the disinformation. Also, humor helps to counter the irrational anger which motivates people to spread the disinformation.

## iCloud

Unfortunately, although Audrey is a [key sponsor][] of [sandstorm][] (self hosted platform for open source applications), and introduces sandstorm to Taiwan government, she herself still relies on iCloud to sync personal files.

I am a bit uncertain about the future of JetBrains. They put a lot of efforts to ship great IDEs. But new languages are very serious about tooling and development productivity to attract more users. vscode has greater out of box support for TypeScript than WebStrom. And the Rust extension of vscode is developed by the IDE and editors team of the Rust language people (yes, they have a dedicated team for this).

There is a conflict of interest for JetBrains. For new languages, language sever is the way to go. It is very difficult for JetBrains to develop an alternative competitive code intelligence system, particularly when new languages like TypeScript and Rust are evolving very fast. So the only choice of JetBrains is to embrace the language sever. But language server is neutral to all editors and IDEs, thus it will not give JetBrains any advantage. And to earn money from those "professional" versions, JetBrains may deliberately remove features from free versions. For example, [debugger and profiler for Rust are only available in their nonfree CLion IDE][rust-clion].

[rust-clion]: https://areweideyet.com/#intellij

The same thing happens to JetBrains' own language, Kotlin. Android Studio/IntelliJ have greatest support for Kotlin, and Eclipse have decent support for Kotlin. But JetBrains people are not willing to support other editors or develop a language server. There is a conflict of interest: to attract more developers to use Kotlin, they need to support more IDEs and editors, while to attract more developers to use their IDEs, they'd better only support their own IDEs.

JetBrains IDEs still have the state of art IDEs for languages such as Java, Python, Go. But their language servers may catch up in future, puting JetBrains IDEs in an awkward situation.

The three most popular style guides in JavaScript community (airbnb, standard, google) are all unnecessarily lengthy.

For example, they all contain a lot of rules on spacing. Is spacing that important? If so, why not just use prettier? If not, why bother to list them in a style guide?

Another example is they all tell you to write `let arr = [];` instead of `let arr = new Array()`. I personally tend to write `[]` but if a ~~Java~~ developer writes `new Array()` instead, what's wrong with that? It is totally harmless.

Style guides should keep focus on a dozen of matters truly important, in other words, pitfalls of JavaScript design, e.g. using `===` instead of `==`.

Years ago I noticed that WebStorm (2016.3) was very slow to detect type errors with Flow, while vscode (with vscode-flow-ide extension) checked error on saving file instantly.

Today I found out that `// @ts-check` against JSDoc comments works out of box with vscode, while WebStorm (2019.3) cannot recognize `@template` with `@typedef`.

This is yet another example that WebStrom is becoming more and more less relevant in JavaScript development these years.

The ancient Chinese saying "steal the whole country and they make you a prince, steal a hook and they hang you" (竊國者侯，竊鉤者誅) probably describes integer overflow. In a system people with a positive sin value will be punished and those with a negative sin value will be rewarded, one who stole the whole country gained a lot of sin value, causing a sin value overflow.

        C.render()
        return C

      useState(initialValue) {
        state = state || initialValue
        function setState(newValue) {
          state = newValue
        }
        return [state, setState]
      }
    }
})()

const useState = SimpleReact.useState
const render = SimpleReact.render

function useCountCharacters(str) {
    const [text, setText] = useState(str)
    const len = text.length
    return [len, setText]
}

    const [len, setLen] = useCountCharacters("")
    return {

For parsing simplicity, the existential operator from CoffeeScript turns into something like `foo ?? bar()`, `a?.[1]`, and `f.(x)` in JavaScript (stage 3), to avoid confusion with ternary expression (`a ? [b] :c`).

IMO `??` is acceptable, but `a?.[1]` is really very ugly. And in fact this reveals a fundamental problem of JavaScript:

JavaScript sucks. Thus people add more features as workarounds. But people cannot remove features from it (otherwise it may become a bigger tragedy than Python 2/3). So JavaScript still sucks, and becomes more bloated and uglier at the same time.

Touch bar does have some advantages:

1. providing context aware UI controls, like buttons, slides, etc
2. showing explicitly the state of the button, e.g. the mute/unmute button

But there is a long way to go:

1. The touch bar need to provide more physical like feedback.
2. The application need to allow user to configure controls, to keep some common operations in a fixed position, e.g. F5 (refresh) for browsers.
3. The application need to pay great attention to design the touch bar controls, to offer a consistent and convenient  UI. For example, in Spark (an email client on Mac OS X), if I click the move button in the toolbar, the popup menu will list suggested folders first. However, if I press the move button on the touch bar, the touch bar just shows the full list (I have to slide for more folders), and the suggested list is missing.

The dark theme of Spark (a mail client on osx) is a disaster. I've to change the setting to "always use light theme". The reason is few mail clients (including those Web Clients) have considered dark background in designing default HTML email templates. And it seems that Spark has not implement some smart algorithm to swap colors.

The old fashioned plain text emails play nicely with dark theme. Another example of simple design is more future proof.

Future programmers may use different abstractions. Today we can write bytes to a file, and tomorrow we may write to a [blob]. Whether the blob is ultimately a file or some cloud storage service is just implementation details.

Just watched the [The Tragedy of systemd][video], which I thought is very misleading.

[video]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_AIw9bGogo

Particularly, the video tries to justify systemd via connecting it with launchd. But although systemd is inspired by launchd,  launchd is not that bloated as systemd.  Also, besides macOS, iOS also uses launchd. However the video does not explain why Android (nowadays the majority of linux users are Android users) does not use systemd if systemd is as elegant as the video claims.

And the video also talks about docker and containers, without realizing that containers make systemd irrelevant. On the server side, services are packaged as containers, which are managed by docker, k8s, etc. Technically there is still an init daemon starting the service program inside the container and communicating with `docker`, but this is somehow implementation detail not interested by developers. And to reduce resource overhaul, a lot of containers use alpine linux as base image, and alpine linux does not use systemd at all. Even if you intend to use Ubuntu or CentOS as base image for your container, Docker recommend you to use [pre-built images with the tini init][tini].

To be honest, I like neither android, docker, nor systemd. I am not sure the fact that both android and docker are not in favor of systemd makes me more depressive or less depressive.

React has so many opt-in, legacy, experimental features. Thus I suggest taking a look at ReasonReact first, which has a much smaller API surface. After a glance of ReasonReact, you can probably pick up React quickly by skipping a lot of concepts. I guess this will be faster than learning React directly, particularly when you are already familiar with some static typed functional languages such as OCaml, F#, and Haskell.

Though I do not suggest diving deep into ReasonReact and actually write code in it, since TypeScript has a far more better ecosystem.

And the first koan of "Kotlin Koans" from stepik and JetBrains annoyed me again.

It requires to write a function returning `"OK"`, given the following hint:

```kotlin
fun start(): String = TODO()
```

So easy (sounds familiar?)

```kotlin
fun start(): String {
  return "OK"
}
```

No, the EduTools plugin does not allow me to delete `=`!

So I have to write the expected answer to pass the koan.

```kotlin
fun start(): String = "OK"
```

Hmm, stupid auto answer detection system. And I wonder why introduce learners the special single expression function in the very beginning, before the normal and more common used function with block body? A lot of functions are hard, if not impossible, to declare as a single expression function. Besides, learners familiar with other programming languages will pick up the normal function with block body syntax almost immediately. Why burden their progress insanely?

Just tried the first three quizs of [Python introduction course on stepik][stepik], which is included in JetBrains' PyCharm Educational (I tried it with the EduTools plugin on IntelliJ).

[stepik]: https://stepik.org/course/238

The first quiz is:

```python
print("Hello, world! My name is type your name")
```

So easy.

```python
print("Hello, world! My name is weakish.")
```

Failed! It turns out that the auto answer detection system thinks it is wired that my name is `weakish.`! Obviously the first quiz is to teach you just follow the instruction brainlessly. "My name ..." starts with a capital character, so it is a sentence. It is reasonable to end a sentence with a period (`.`), although this will fail the quiz.

The second quiz introduces comments, without telling the learner comment is used for what.

And the third quiz introduces variable, but its first line is:

```python
a = b = 2
```

What? Introducing chained assignment before normal variable assignment (`a = 2`)?

Chained assignment is not often used in practice. And I do not think it is necessary to introducing it to beginners.

In fact it is not only unnecessary, but confusing.

A beginner may guess that `a = b = 2` is equivalent to:

```python
a = 2
b = 2
```

For a value `2`, they are indeed equivalent, but:

```python
import random
a = b = random.random()
```

is not equivalent to:

```python
a = random.random()
b = random.random()
```

And programmers from other languages such as C and JavaScript, may think `a = b = 2` is equivalent to `a = (b = 2)` where `b = 2` evaluates to `2`. But this is not true in Python.

And the course mentioned nothing about these quirks.

I guess the author may think `a = 2` is too boringly obvious to introduce, thus turns to introducing chain assignment directly. No! In fact, considering that in Python variables are reassignable, they are not boring for beginners at all.

Considering the following lines:

```python
a = 2
a = 3
```

This is not boring for a beginner. How can `a` be equal to both `2` and `3`? Seems mathematically impossible!

This is what the author really have to talk about, not chain assignment.

I myself learned Python via reading the A Byte of Python book years ago. I am not sure if I should recommend it to beginners. Compared to [HtDP] for the exotic Scheme language and the outdated [Why's Guide to Ruby][why], it is somehow a boring book. And Python's official tutorial is well written. But at least it does not have such flaws.

Just came across a video titled [Learn Python Programming Language in 2 Hours][video].

The speaker argues that the first reason to use Python is:

> Solve complex problems in **less time** and **fewer lines of code**

[video]: https://youtu.be/yE9v9rt6ziw

with the following example:

```
C# str.Substring(0, 3)
JavaScript str.substr(0, 3)
Python str[0:3]
```

I do not want to talk about technical details like C# 8.0 supports slicing notation (`str[0..3]`) and `substr` is a legacy function in JavaScript (use `slice` instead). What I want to say is that all of the three languages take one line of code to solve the problem, and with a decent editor/IDE, all three lines take equal time to type. Even assuming we all do programming with a basic text editor like Notepad on Windows or Leafpad in Linux, this example still has nothing to do with solving complex problems in less time. This problem is not complex at all. And most time of programming is not spent on typing.

Currently this video has 411k views, 8.1k upvotes (less than 200 downvotes) on YouTube. I think this is a good example of why learning to code is hard: so many poor and popular teaching materials on Internet.

Android's Messages app does not provide a "delete all" function. Fortunately, most popular third-party sms apps all support "delete all" or "select all then delete", e.g. chompSMS, Handcent Next SMS, Textra.

Considering the fact that in early versions of Android, the messaging app does have this feature, my conspiracy theory is Google do not like us to delete our SMS, which could be analyzed by Google to build smarter AI and sell more ads.

But without using the extension, it is still possible to learn enough Flask to write your first REST API service in Flask within 30 minutes.

1. [The sample code][sample] showing how to do REST API and test it.
2. [path variable](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#variable-rules)
3. [request method and parameters](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#the-request-object)

5. [launch the application](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)

[sample]: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/testing/#testing-json-apis

Unfortunately, figuring out these five sections in three chapters ("quickstart", "testing", "pattern") are the relative pieces for a quick start of REST API service already costs me more than 30 minutes. :-(

Most web video player lacks the feature of full browser window. Fortunately, with xrandr under Linux, we can split the physical monitor into multiple virtual monitors.

For example, given a monitor 1920x1080 (476mm x 268mm) connected as `HDMI-1`, the following commands will split into two virtual monitors:

```sh
xrandr --setmonitor left 960/254x1080/286+0+0 HDMI-1
xrandr --setmonitor right 960/254x1080/286+960+0 none
```

Note that not all window managers respect this setting though. For example, I have no luck with KWin (KDE) and Mutter (Gnome). On the other hand, xfce and openbox do respect this.

Briefly tried Manjaro:

The installation is smooth and it works out of the box.

But it is problematic with package dependencies:

1. The dependencies declaration of Arch package is less rigid, compared to Debian/Fedora/Opensuse, etc.
2. New arch packages are postponed to enter Manjaro's repository, which causes missing dependencies.

Recently I learned a new notion (or buzzword, if you prefer), [edge computing]:

[edge computing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing

> Edge computing brings memory and computing power closer to the location where it is needed.

Hmm, this let me rethink the statement that ZeroNet is uncensored.

Maybe ZeroNet is not uncensored, instead, it is *edge censored*.

Let me cite the definition of censorship from Wikipedia:

> Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or "inconvenient".

Such material is objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or "inconvenient" to who? To me, the content consumer. So, inspired by the idea of edge computing, the censorship system should bring memory and computing power closer to me, the location where censorship is needed.

That is what ZeroNet does, **edge censorship**. Let the user/client/node/hub decide to mute and ban what content and which content producer.

The download page of Manjaro offers 11 favors, xfce, kde, cinnamon, openbox, awesome, budgie, mate, I3, Architect (text), Deepin, Gnome. And there are tabs (it turns out these are actually pretended checkboxes) like "beginner-friendly", "resource-efficient", "traditionally-workflow".

I clicked the "resource-efficient" tab, and there are 10 favors. In other words, only Gnome is considered as resource inefficient!

So, according to Manjaro, all Linux Graphical Desktop Environments are efficient (and none Graphical Desktop Environment is also efficient, of course), except for Gnome.

This must be joking.

 (I used KDE for two or three years and haven't used recent versions of Gnome, so I am unsure if Gnome is resource inefficient nowadays. If it is, then the resource inefficient Gnome is joking; if it is not, then Manjaro is making a joke about Gnome. That's why this must be joking. ;-)

Just read an insightful blog post by [André Staltz] talking about [the dying web] replaced by the GOOG-FB-AMZN Trinet.

Actually the web is dying faster in China, where FB = Tencent, AMZN = Ali. Baidu tries to follow Google's strategy, shifting from a search oriented company to an AI oriented one. But apparently it is a failure.

Reasons why web is dying faster in China:

1. As a developing country, mobile phones are the only devices to connect to Internet for a lot of people. And a lot of people first go online through mobile applications. And most likely these mobile applications are directly owned by Tencent or Ali, or by companies controlled by Tencent or Ali.
2. Mobile payment is far more ubiquitous in China. (Unsurprisingly, the two most popular mobile payment methods are Ali's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay.)
3. Both Tencent and Ali make their products very inconvenient to use on the web, lacking a lot of important features. They force user to use the mobile application instead. And there is no  regulation preventing them to do so.
4. On the other side, regulation requires every user to bind a mobile phone number to use every web service.
5. And obviously the authority dislike the open and free web. It is inconvenient and somehow dangerous to host an ordinary website. Want to host a forum? Even harder. Want to host a video site? No way! (Well, technically it is possible if you are a giant company or have strong connections with government.)

In golden old days, a simple web page has an index.html, linking to an index.js. I can just open the index.html in a web browser to see the effect. And after some edits of index.html or index.js, I just refresh the page to see the effect. Once I am satisfied, I can copy the directory to any static hosting space.

Nowadays, a simple web application has an index.html, liking to an index.js, which may import a lot of npm packages. Assuming these npm dependencies are already fulfilled (via `npm install --save`), [parcel] bring me back to the golden old time:

```sh
parcel index.html
```

[parcel]: https://parceljs.org/

Then I can just check the effect at http://localhost:1234/. And once I made an edit to index.html or index.js, it will get rebuilt and refresh automatically.

Once the development is done, I just run `parcel build index.html`, then deploy/copy the `dist/` directory to any static hosting space.

And if I get bored, I can replace index.js with index.ts, and start coding in TypeScript. This works out of box with parcel. This also applies to CoffeeScript, or Elm, or even Rust (via WebAssembly).

None of webpack, browserify, and rollup is as zero configuration as parcel.

Saw this piece of Go code when watching [Advanced Testing With Go][youtube] by Mitchell Hashimoto:

[youtube]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszygk1cpEc

```go
func testChdir(t *testing.T, dir string) func() {
  old, err := os.Getwd()
  // change directory and handle potential errors
  return func() { os.Chdir(old) }
}

func TestThing(t *testing.T) {
  defer testChdir(t, "/other")()
  // ...
}
```

`defer testChdir(t, "/other")()` is a clever trick:

1. `defer` got `testChdir(t, "/other")()`, and to figure out what to register, `testChdir(t, "/other")` got evaluated. This let side effects contained in `testChdir` executed now.
2. After the evaluation, `defer` registered the anonymous function `testChdir` returns, whose execution will be deferred.

Just one line, brief and clever. But I think this is too brief and too clever.

A quick google revealed that someone else already pointed out this pattern (`defer db.connect()()`) as [bad practice]. Besides, they also listed [other] 14 [gotchas] of `defer`.

[bad practice]: https://blog.learngoprogramming.com/gotchas-of-defer-in-go-1-8d070894cb01
[other]: https://blog.learngoprogramming.com/5-gotchas-of-defer-in-go-golang-part-ii-cc550f6ad9aa
[gotchas]: https://blog.learngoprogramming.com/5-gotchas-of-defer-in-go-golang-part-iii-36a1ab3d6ef1

This makes me wondering whether the benefit of introducing `defer` justify its confusion and complexity.

BTW, another reason that `defer testChdir(t, "/other")()` smells to me is it is error-prone. What if forget to type `()`? After all, `defer f()` looks quite innocent during a code review.

The 15 gotchas author suggested an alternative style, which is clearer and less error-prone:

```go
close := db.connect()
defer close()
```

But I do not feel nature that `connect()` should return a function on how to closing it. Thus I prefer the dumb way:

```go
db.connect()
defer db.close()
```

GraalVM's native image feature is impressive to me:

The startup time of a Java program is faster than a Python script, at the same level of Lua and Go.

Currently GraalVM only supports amd64 linux/osx (there is preview distribution for Windows). No FreeBSD, no arm, etc.

Also, native image for JVM languages other than Java are primitive. In fact the `default.jar` above is a Ceylon hello world program (generated via `ceylon fat-jar`). And the native image is generated from the following command:

```sh
native-image --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime --static -jar default.jar
```

(This is undocumented at GraalVM's official documentation. Thanks to [Lucas Werkmeister] to supply the command.)

However, currently this only works for simple Ceylon programs.

But graal does looks promising to me.

I read the first 4 items of Effective Java 2nd. edition several years ago, and had an impression that the book better renamed to Ineffective Java. There are 78 items total in the Effective Java 2nd. editon. Today I just learned that Effective Java updated to 3rd. edition on the end of 2017, targeting Java 9 (2nd. edition is target at Java 6). Now there are 90 items in the book. I am wondering does this imply that Java is more ineffective now? Or maybe People have finally discovered far more pitfalls of Java, thus although recent versions of Java fixed some issues, the net known ineffectiveness increases?

Go advertises itself as having first class functions:

```go
return alternativeImpl(
    x, y,
    func (a int, b int) int { return a + b },
    func (a int64, b int64) int64 { return a + b },
    big.NewInt(0).Add)
```

With operator function and overloading/generics, this could have been shortened to:

```go
return alternativeImpl(x, y, +, big.NewInt(0).Add)
```

BTW:

- `big.NewInt(0).Add` looks wired to me. It is not something like `curriedAdd = add 0`, but means initialize a big.Int (here `0` is the empty value on initialization, and Go forces to assign an empty value on initialization) which receives the result of Add.
- GoLand is not very good at analyzing these higher order functions. Sometimes GoLand reported "No problems found" but actually the code does not compile.

Currently I'm using a tree based todo manager, roughly something like:

```lisp
[task1
  [subtask1
   subtask2
     subsubtask1
  ...]]]
 task 2
 ...]
```

I'm quite satisfied with it for a few months, and found that it is much more expressive than former flat todo managers I've used.

But today I find out that I need to express something like this:

```lisp
[task1
  (cond1
      [subtask1
       subtask2
          (cond1.1
             [subsubtask1

              othersubtask2])
       subtask3]
      [othersubtask1
       othersubtask2
...
```

Hmm, tree based todos are cool. But eventually I will need an AST (abstract syntax tree) to manage todos?

RubyGems has a so-called  *twiddle-wakka* shortcut `~>`. Therefore, assuming in a semver setup, you can write `~> 2.2` instead of the verbose `['>= 2.2.0', '< 3.0']`. Seems neat, isn't it?

However, later Alice reported a bug about the software, and Bob found out that the bug is caused by a bug from the library it depends, which has already be fixed in `2.2.2`. So Bob changed the dependency to `~> 2.2.2`. The bug was gone, all tests passed, and everything looked great.

However, `~> 2.2.2` is not equivalent to  `['>= 2.2.2', '< 3.0']` (Bob thought so), but `['>= 2.2.2', '< 2.3.0']`!

Recently the term "headless CMS" and "decoupled CMS" gain a lot of popularity. But these two terms are rather confusing to me.

To me, "headless CMS" sounds like some system mainly intended to be used with `curl` etc. on command line, like [ix.io](http://ix.io/) the headless pastebin. However, obviously most people use the term "headless CMS" in a different way.

| What people say | What I would call it |
| - | - |
| headless CMS | decoupled CMS |
| decoupled CMS | decoupled CMS with default UI and templates |

BTW, I wish the next generation of website will be both frontend agnostic and gateway agnostic. That is, a user of a website can directly access those micro-services. And optionally they may provide some default gateways and/or frontends. Just like a user of a programming library/framework can directly access those low-level functions/classes. And optionally the library/framework may provide some high level APIs and/or examples.

Ansible advertises itself as agent-less, but:

1. The agent/client machine still needs to have a (compatible version of) python preinstalled.
2. SaltStack supports an equivalent server-only  model (also requiring python). And SaltStack is more flexible since it also supports server-agent  and agent-only models.

On the other hand, Patchwork (based on fabric) is true agentless (sending shell calls). Its functions is quite limited and it lacks high-level abstractions though.

BTW, the cloud provider modules from both Ansible and SaltStack are disorderly and unsystematic. Some use cloud providers' SDK, some use libcloud (a unified interface for different cloud APIs), and some directly use requests.

Flickr will limit free users' photos to 1000 (extra photos will get deleted in next year). Upon hearing this I am quite depressed, because downloading photos and uploading to a new platform (provided that I can find an alternative) will take a lot of time and effort.

Later I learned that flickr will not delete old photos licensed under Creative Commons. Thank goodness! Almost all my photos on flickr are under cc-by-sa or public domain.

Today I just checked my flickr account and found out that I only have less than five hundreds photos there...

Upgraded KDE Neon from 16.04 to 18.04 today via its built-in "Distribution Upgrade" GUI. The whole process is mostly smooth, except it reports a mysterious error "installArchives() Failed" before restart. I just ignored it and had not discovered anything wrong.

The system feels the same, without any dramatic change. I have not noticed any difference until I decided to change the wallpaper:

1. Plasma Wallpaper now allows to use Bing's Picture of the Day.
2. Plasma Mouse Actions now supports configuring all mouse buttons.

I used to rebind middle key to forward button (so I can press it via my thumb, instead of clicking the hard-to-press wheel) via `xinput set-button-map`. I knew I had to add it to my startup script, but because: 1) I am lazy; 2) I seldom restart my computer these days; I did not write it. Now I do not need to write it -- another example of advantage of "lazy evaluation". ;-)

Refactoring with statically typed code (using Python's type hint) is an enjoyable process. To switch an  upstream library, I just replaced one import statement, one type definition, and one invoking statement. Then I just fix all the typing problems reported by PyCharm. After that, I run the program and find out that it just works! No "find usage" or "search and replace". And the project does not have any test (I am too lazy to write one.) Static typing is the preservative to slow down the inevitable decaying of code.

- Vert.x (backend) + Dart (web) + Flutter (mobile)

(To me, this is not excited at all, though. ;-)

My personal choices to score movies:

1. WTF
2. I do not want to waste my time on this
3. to kill some time
4. I probably will not watch it again, but I am not object to
5. I will watch it again

So forgive me for being harsh to a lot of movies,
I am poor, thus:

- I am busy with earning a living, not having time to watch so many movies;
- I have to limit the money spending on extra movie tickets.

However, I still watch quite a lot of movies after all.
Thanks to my just the right amount of poverty, I can afford buying movie tickets, and cannot afford some other more expensive forms of entertainment. In fact I am not sure, movie is entertainment to me. Maybe it is rather a form of escaping of the desert of reality? Or, maybe all forms of entertainment are ways of escaping to me?

One of my favorite poem of Li Ch'ing-chao (李清照) is "As in a Dream" (如夢令）.

Light rain and gusty wind last night. （昨夜雨疏風驟）
Sound sleep did not dispel the slight drunkenness. （濃睡不消殘酒）
I ask the one rolling up the curtain,　（試問卷簾人）
but she answers: "The cherry-apple trees are the same."　（卻道海棠依舊）
"Don't you know? Don't you know? The red should languish while the green should plump."　（知否，知否，應是綠肥紅瘦）

(I am a native speaker of Chinese but not a native speaker of English. I tried my best to translate it. Any feedback on translation is welcome.)

"The red should languish while the green should plump" reveals the tenderness of the poet, while "should" implies the firmness of the poet.

"Don't you know? Don't you know?" That is the reality distortion field of a groggy poet.

Just published my first Firefox extension: [arxiv-url], a Firefox addon to replace arxiv pdf links to corresponding abstract links.

[arxiv-url]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arxiv-url/

Writing a firefox extension is actually easier than I thought. If you'd like to write one yourself, just follow mozilla's [doc].

[doc]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

Note:

1. If you do not want to install `web-ext` (it depends on node and some npm packages) for `web-ext build`, you can just zip your extension.
2. Submit the zip file to  [AMO] directly. No need to `web-ext sign` it (if you did so, the signature will be replaced with AMO after all.)

Moving one icon on my mobile phone, all icons between the old place and the new place of the moved icon, will shift their places.

I am really upset by this.

Image in an insane programming lanuage, there is a list, say,

```python
l = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
```

And when you eval `l[0] = l[6]`, the list becomes:

```python
l = [g, a, b, c, d, e, f]
```

What a big surprise!

In such a programming language, imaging how many statements you have to write to accomplish simple tasks such as swaping `a` and `g`.

On the other side, in any sane programming language, to swap `a` and `g`, you just need to write something like:

```python
tmp = l[0]
l[0] = l[6]
l[6] = tmp
```

That is basically the behavior of desktop shortcuts of old-fashioned desktop operating systems.

I encountered this design fault on iOS devices before.
And now it infects my Android phone.
(Not sure whether Android 8.0 or the mobile phone producer introduced this design fault.)

My workaround: Only put icons most frequently used on the first screen. Put all other icons in folders. And arrange those folders by their names, pretending that they cannot be arranged freely.

Compared to C like syntax, ML/Haskell saves some typing of commas and parenthesis.

The intuition behind Curry-Howard correspondence:

1. Staring from propositions (types of parameters),  we construct proof (function) to get other proposition (type of return value).
2. The rule to construct proof (function) is called logic (type system).
3. It is hard to construct a proof (function). But once the proof (function) has been constructed, it is easy to verify the proof is valid (the function does return the value of specified type).

Notes:

1. In practice, the verification of proof is not always easy, because real word proof tends to omit a lot of implicit knowledge and intermediate steps.
2. The verification of returned type of function is so easy that we do not need to verify that manually, the interpreter/compiler will verify that for us automatically.
3. The Curry-Howard correspondence is the basis of theorem prover such as Coq.

Failed to understand the `fmap` signature in Haskell in about 15 minutes:

```haskell

```

It took me about 15 minutes to realize that
I have seen too many curried functions
so my brain instantly parses

```haskell
(a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

as

```swift
((a -> b), f(a)) -> f(b)
```

instead of the intended

```swift
(a -> b) -> (f(a) -> f(b))

A programmer's client (a local cinema) website got hacked, with racist messages posted. The policy suspected the programmer hacked the site, and got a warrant to seize the programmer's computer. Then they sent **21 armed polices**, 3 of them to seize the computer, and **18 of them as witness**.

On early morning, these polices **broke in** the programmer's home, and **shot dead** the programmer when he is talking to his lawyer on the phone (**4 shots on chest and face**).
And the **18 witness polices** witnessed that the programmer fired a crossbow bolt at one of them (that police was protected by Kevlar thus slightly injured).

This is *not* something happening in a magic realism novel or an absurdist  movie. This is what happened on **December 23rd 2016**, **London, Ontario, Canada**.

The programmer is **Sam Maloney**, the creator of [morphis](https://morph.is/) (a free open source p2p distributed datastore), a husband and a father of two children.

The so called whatsapp 'backdoor' was documented in the [blog post of Open Whisper Systems on 05 Apr 2016](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/).

I think the notification on security code for a contact changing should be "opt out" instead of "opt in". I guess Facebook made this "opt in" so users having no idea of public key encryption will not get confused by the security code change notification. They could make it "opt out" with a detailed explanation on first notification of security code change instead, in my own opinion.

I would rather call it a less secure design choice. Anyway, no matter you think it is a backdoor or not, it is not news.

This is what Ubuntu put on its front page about 10 years ago.

Nowadays these words are missing from the entire site of ubuntu.com
(the only place left is the handbook of LTS, maybe no one bothered to update the preface of the handbook?)

And this is what now on the front page of ubuntu.com:

> Ubuntu is an open source software platform that runs from the cloud, to the smartphone, to all your things.

Mark Shuttleworth used to think "the next big thing" is "build a platform so people can share free (as in freedom) things such as software, music, etc".

Later "the next big thing" of Ubuntu gradually changed to "universal user experience on all devices", which is less uncertain since Apple has already been a successful example.
(Apple is determined to make Mac OS X more and more like iOS, and make Apple laptops more and more like iPads.)

Not know how well Ubuntu will do in next 10 years.
Anywhere, "universal user experience" has nothing to do with the  original Nguni Bantu word "Ubuntu".

If you run ZeroNet on a remote machine, the doc recommends enabling `UiPassword`. But if your are using an unsafe network (public wifi, evil ISP, etc), password is transferred over insecure HTTP protocol. So for safety, you need to configure a reverse proxy with SSL for ZeroNet.

Alternatively, you can just start ZeroNet on remote machine as normal,
without `--ui_ip`, `UiPassword`, reverse proxy, SSL, etc.
And run this command at local machine:

    ssh -L 43110:127.0.0.1:43110 -N username@remote

Then you can just access `http://127.0.0.1:43110/` on your local machine, securely.

[Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) is similar to ZeroNet. Their difference:

- Beaker does not host visited sites.  (You can enable it manually.)
- Beaker sites support versioning.
- Beaker API is much simpler than ZeroNet, no select user (id), no optional file, no encryption, etc. So dynamic sites are easier to create via ZeroNet.
- ZeroNet uses namecoin `.bit`. Beaker uses regular domain names (via `TXT` record. It's experimental, not man-in-the-middle attack proof ).

Also, because Beaker requires  a customized browser:

- it uses `dat://` schema.
- Beaker sites need to ask user permission to access clearnet.

(These are not substantial differences since anyone can make a customized browser for Zeronet.)

Other differences are technical details, like ZeroNet is written in Python, while Beaker is written in JavaScript, and ZeroNet uses base58 encoded site address (compatible with bitcoin), while Beaker uses hex encoded address.

C is a hacky language. For example, string in C. If you think string in C is an array of characters, then you cannot put some characters in string (such as Unicode character) and you can put some noncharacters into string. If you think string is an an array of bytes, like a buffer, then you cannot put the byte `\0` into string. So string in C is inconsistent viewed from both high level and low level.

Go, advertised as modern C, inherits C's hacky mindset:

- Error handling. Go uses multiple return values to represent union type `Result | SomeError` or optional type `Result | Null`: returning either `{result, nil}` or `{nil, error}`. The ordering of `result` and `error`, and one and only one of them must be `nil` is just a convention followed by programmers, not enforced by type system.

- For variable declaration without initialization, instead of checking it is correctly initialized later, Go just implicitly initialize it with a zero value. Even worse, Go uses `nil` as zero value for pointers, slices, interfaces, maps, channels, and functions.

@zeronetuseri6293 asked how to explain Systemd is bad "like I am five". I just prepare some text to brainwash five-year-old "Systemd is bad":

You are five. You do not know how to cook pasta, how to bake bread, and how to clean the window, etc. Fortunately there are a lot of volunteers to help you to do all these things.

The problem is these volunteers tend to commit suicide because of intrinsic depression. (They think helping a five year old may helps to reduce depression.)  And you are lazy and shy. You do not want to manage them yourself. There is a magician called Sysfive. When you go to sleep, Sysfive will kill those volunteers (not let them go home to avoid  traffic jam), and when you awake, Sysfive will reborn those volunteers. Also if you find some volunteer killed themselves, you can ask Sysfive to reborn them.

These volunteers speak a language named Gnome. You happen to speak this language, too. And all those volunteers are from the same nation Debian. Debian is located at a continent called Linux. The continent Linux is located at a planet called unix.

Your friends have volunteers speaking different languages like KDE and Xfce, from different places like OpenSUSE (also on Linux continent) and FreeBSD (on the BSD continent), and different magicians like OpenRC and RunIt (one magician can work for a lot of children.) You talked with your friends, and found out that you can find volunteers speaking Gnome from any nation and continent. Also, although volunteers from some certain countries only have experience with some magicians, all magicians can reborn volunteers from any country with some effort. "This is good. Maybe one day I will ask FreeBSD volunteers to help me. One of my friends said FreeBSD volunteers are cool." You thought. "And maybe one day I can ask RunIt the master to reborn volunteers for me. I heard that Sysfive the master is too old."

Until one day, you learned that Systemd the master can only reborn volunteers from the Linux continent. Systemd refuses to reborn any volunteer from other continents such as BSD and Solaris.

Also you learned that soon volunteers speaking Gnome can only be reborn by Systemd. They refuse to be reborn by other magicians.

Also, there used to be different volunteers to do different things, for example, one helps you to do accounting (e.g. how much ham you have eaten, eating ham is bad for your health), and one configures your smart phone (smart phones are too smart to configure for a five year old). But
Systemd said: "I am very very powerful. I will do all these things. Send those volunteers away."

You as a five year old may not think Systemd is bad.
But I hope you understand why some people consider Systemd as "bad".

Brace formatting style

I used to prefer Java style (braces on the same line) over Allman style (braces on their own line). I use large fonts on a small screen, thus a condensed style is preferred.

However, I recently found out that although Java style is clean for simple code, it does not work well with long parameter/conditional list. For example:

```c
if (starts_with(path, home, path_size, home_path_size) ||
    check_with(path, home, path_size, home_path_size) {
    recreate(path, home);
    return home_path_size;
} else {
    return 0;
}
```

The simple statement `return 0` in else branch is clear.
But I cannot tell whether `recreate(path, home)` belongs to the conditional list or the function body at a glance.

On the other side, I can get the whole structure at a glance with Allman style:

```c
if (starts_with(path, home, path_size, home_path_size) ||
    check_with(path, home, path_size, home_path_size)
{
    recreate(path, home);
    return home_path_size;
}
else
{
    return 0;
}
```

Also, since I use large fonts on small screen,
I can not read `if (long || next_line ) {` at once.
So the Java style requires me to move my eyes to right, then move my eyes back to next line, which is slow.
With Allman style, to get an overview of structure,
I only need to focus on the left half of the code block, and no eye movements are needed. This makes up the wasted lines.

I guess for large screens a few wasted lines is affordable for clarity.

Maybe the Java style is suitable for a setup with small fonts on a small screen, provided the syntax highlight scheme distinguishes braces clearly?

Firefox version 41 to 50 (including 45 ESR used by the latest version of the Tor browser) has a memory corruption vulnerability allows malicious code to be executed on Windows, thus deanonymize Tor users.

To protect yourself from similar possible future vulnerabilities:

1. the ultimate 2 physical machine solution: use two physical machine A and B. A has only one lan card to connect to B (make sure A does not have a wireless card, or has a physical switch to turn off wireless card).  B has 2 lan card, one for A, one for Internet. Running the browser on A and Tor on B,  and the connection between A and B is configured as NAT only. So A can only connect to Internet via Tor, and possible vulnerability in browser can only leak IP/MAC etc of A, not B. For max security, do not buy A online, incase the online seller may record A's hardware information together with your identity/address.

2. the 2 virtual machine solution: similarly to the solution above, but use two Virtual machine instead. This does not protect you from virtual emualtor's escape vul­nerabilities though. However, virtual emualtor's escape vulnerabilities are rare (and your machine need to encounter both virtual emualtor's escape vulnerability and browser's vulnerability at the same time to leak the information of physical machine).

3. Less secure than the above solutions, but the easiest: Use Tor Browser with JavaScript off, or at least block JavaScript by default, and whitelist sites you trusted.

Kotlin uses `Array<T>` for `vararg p: T` (variadic functions) underhood, but:

- Basic types are special, e.g. `IntArray` for `vararg p: Int`.
- `p: Array<T>` and `vararg p: T` behaves differently. In other words, given a function `Array<T> -> Unit`, we do not know how to invoke it just from its signature. (`Array<T> -> Unit` may be an infix function, but all infix functions can be invoked as normal functions.)

JavaScript's ASI (auto semicolon insertion) is confusing. However, if I prefer to not omit semicolons, I only need to remember one rule: not  breaking line after `throw`. (There are other rules, but I am unlikely to write code related to other rules, e.g. `i\n++\nb`.)

On the other side,  if I prefer to omit semicolons, I need to remember additional rules:

- `(`
- `[`
- `.`
- `,`
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- `for` and `while`

Thus my choice is not omitting semicolons.

- Status (Ideation, action, etc) is unclikable on overview.
- Note markup is Rich text, no option for markdown.
- No markup for code block.
- When change status from ideation to action, assign to no one by default, should assign to the one change status by default.

For any one want to pick up programming language , I recommend [The Little Schemer](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992)，less than 200 pages and can be finished in a weekend. It starts from zero and gradually introduces concepts like recursion, higher-order functions, curry, Church encoding, halting problem, lambda calculus,  fixed point, Y combinator, continuation, CPS, Godel Incompleteness Theorem, and a basic interperator for a simplified progarmming language.

If you think The Little Schemer is expensive, you can try [CoffeeScript Ristretto](https://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto), somehow a translation of The Little Schemer to CoffeeScript, which can be read on line for free.

Do not worry the above books do not use a language you are going to use in your work. After all, the right approach to pick the certain programming language you are going to use is to focus on  semantics, instead of syntax; focus on concepts, instead of concrete details; focus on good parts, instead of all parts; also learning the implemantation of the language is a good way, since modeling is an effective way of learning (no need a full implement, also not worry about performance, just implement basic and import concepts).  The Littele Schemer fully conforms to this approach. Once you learned the scheme language with it, you know how to learn a new languge, and you know essential concepts of programing language. Then you can just pick up any language you are going to use in the same way. And because you only need to understand new semantics and concepts of the new language, it will be fast. For syntax, just use a good IDE or setup your editor properly.

In Ceylon, cases in `switch` need to be both disjoint and exhausted. Using a strict form helps to reduce bugs.

For example, suppose we have the following code:

```ceylon
Path path = current;
if (is Directory path) { // typo, should be `path.resource`.
    // ...
} else { // dead code
    // ...
}
```

There is a typo in the above code, `path` should be `path.resource`.
So the above code will never go into the else branch,
since a Path is always not a Directory.

However, if we use switch with explicit cases:

```ceylon
switch (path)
case (is Directory) {
    // ...
}
case (is File|Link|Nil) {
    // ...
}
```

The compiler will refuse to compile, saying cases are not exhausted.



Date: <a id="1476802731" href="#1476802731">1476802731</a>

I prefer explicit else branch over fall through flow.

For example:

```ceylon
Boolean if_else(Integer x) {
    if (x > 0) {
        if (x < 10) {
            return false;
        }
    } else if (x < -10) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

It is short, but difficult to figure out the control flow.

Rewrite it more explicitly, without omitting else branch:

```ceylon
Boolean if_else(Integer x) {
    if (x > 0) {
        // This is for demonstration only.
        // `if (x > 0, x < 10)` is clearer.
        // Pretend there were more complex branching here.
        if (x < 10) {
            return false;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    } else if (x < -10) {
        return false;
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}
```

Also, avoid using `variable` to save else branch.

For example:

```ceylon
variable Integer x = 0;
if (condition) {
    x = 1;
}
```

can be rewritten to

```ceylon
Integer x;
if (condition) {
    x = 1;
} else {
    x = 0;
}
```

Programming languages are clearer than natural languages. So "well-commented code" may not be well-written.

To reduce commenting:

- Use meaningful function and variable/value name.
- Declare local variable near its usage.
- Avoid deep nested function call expression. Extract meaningful immediate value declaration.

Here 'commenting' mainly refers to inline comments,
i.e. comments explaining implementation details.
Doc annotation of public modules and functions on their usage is fine.

`A then B else C` in Ceylon feels confusing to me.

`A then B else C` looks like `A ? B : C` in other languages, but they are **not the same**:

1. `A then B else C` is actually `(A then B) else C`:

         * `A then B` evaluates to `B` if `A` is not `null`, otherwise evaluates to `null`.
         * `X else Y` evaluates to `X` if `X` is not `null`, otherwise evaluates to `Y`.

2. Thus the type of `B` is `T given T satisfies Object`, i.e. requires to not be `null`.

I think `if (A) then B else C` is much cleaner.

In Python, whitespace (space or tab) can be used: (use dot to indicate whitespace)

to **indedent** code (removing will cause error)

```python
def id(x):
....return x
```

and **align** code (can be safely removed)

```python
x.............= 1
long_variable = 2
```

Thus I think it is a good idea to distinguish them with different characters: use `tab` for **indentation**, and `space` for **alignment**.

PEP 8 has a different opinion:

- Use `space` for indentation.
- Keep code unaligned.

I used to confuse coding style with formatting style. Formatting style like `using n spaces to indent` and `closing brace on its own line` are unlikely to affect readability of code, and they can be auto adjusted via IDE or command line tools. What really matter is coding style, like `if (a=0)` and `++i`. PEP 8 for Python talks a lot about formatting style. This is a cost of Python's layout based (indentation sensitive) syntax: possibly cleaner for small pieces of code, while hard or impossible to be auto formatted by tools like IDEs (crucial for a large code base).

Cloned site private key recovery:

If `This is my site` in site menu does not works, you can try manually recover cloned site private key (they are generated from your master key in BIP32).

**Warning**: untested

- Make sure you are seeding your LostSite.
- Stop Zeronet.
- Get LostSite `address_index` in `data/LostSiteID/content.json`.
- Get your master key `master_seed` in `data/users.json`.
- Edit `Actions.main(self)` in `src/main.py`,  see below.
- Now start Zeronet, you will see site private key in output. Record it.
- Stop Zeronet. Delete recovery code added above.
- Edit `data/users.json`,  fill the record value (quoted) in `privatekey` at LostSiteID.
- Edit `data/sites.json`, set `own` in LostSiteID to `true`.
- Start Zeronet. Now you should be able to edit/publish your site.

Added code in `src/main.py`:

```python
class Actions(object):

I think hg may fit ipfs more well than git. Like git's dumb http, hg supports [static http](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/StaticHTTP). Unlike git's changing-all-the-time packfile, hg's revlog is predictable. So hosting hg repos on ipfs is simpler (no need to unpack objects manually), and saves bandwidth (git repos with unpacked objects is usually larger than hg).

Today I was bitten by `Refused to execute script from ... because its MIME type (text/plain) is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled` when hot-linking a js file hosted on GitHub.

Then I found out that `raw.github.com` is not truely raw access to file asset,
but a view rendered by Rails.
So accessing `raw.github.com` is much heavier than needed.
I don't know why `raw.github.com` is implemented as a Rails view.
Instead of fix this route issue, GitHub added a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.

It sounds like a hot fix to me:

- **A:** Let's just make raw a Rails view, so it is simple to write routing code.
- **B:** But this hurts performance.
- **A:** No, programming time is more valuable than processing time. If more human beings view the raw, let's just convince VCs to invest more money for more machines since we are so successful that we have some many views.
- **B:** But there are sites use GitHub to host scripts.
- **A:** No, they should not do this because Rails view is heavy. Let's block them by adding an HTTP header. It's simple.


Workaround:

- Put the script to `user.github.io/repo`
- Use a third party CDN like rawgit.com.
