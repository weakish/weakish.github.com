# Gemini

Gemini is a protocol "in between Gopher and the web"*, but for me, Gopher is more like FTP, and Gemini is more like HTTP. Gemini does have some pitfalls in its design+, but it is still a good enough alternative to Web with an active community.#

## Gemini Text

If Gemini is to HTTP, then Gemini text is to HTML. It's a line-oriented minimalistic hypertext markup language inspired by Markdown and gophermaps. It has link lines and preformatted text lines. Optionally, it supports three levels of headings, unsorted lists, and quote lines.
There is no syntax for escaping special markers. In other words, it assumes no normal text line will starts with =>, ```, *, #, or >. And no lines in preformatted text block will start with ```.
