## Hardware

- [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html)

    Compact. Inexpensive. Linux friendly.

- HP Z22n G2 Display

    Compact. Accurate color. 1920 x 1080 is sufficient for Linux.
    (I use a 4K display with a MacBook Pro at office.)

- [IKBC C87](https://www.ikbckeyboard.com/product-page/c87)

    * Wired: Bluetooth keyboards may have troubles when booting a full-disk encryption Linux.
    * 80%: Less space but all functional keys (F1-F12, arrow keys, etc) are available.
    * Cherry MX Brown: Cherry MX Switches are reliable. Actually I am fine with both brown and red switches.
    * PBT: Resist to oil, sweat, and lotion. More durable.
    * Steel board: I dislike this. It makes the keyboard heavier.
    * Not programmable: Less convenient but acceptable.

- [Razer DeathAdder Left-handed Edition](https://www.razer.com/eu-en/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-left-handed-edition)

    One of the few left-handed mouses available in my region.
