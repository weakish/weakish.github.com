> ⁴²Bibliographical notes which we extract from the literature, should be captured inside the card index. ⁴³Books, articles, etc., which we have actually read, should be put on a separate slip with bibliographical information in a separate box. ⁴⁴You will then not only be able to determine after some time what you actually read and what you only noted to prepare reading, but you can also add numbered links to the notes, which are based on this work or were suggested by it. ⁴⁵This proves to be helpful because our own memory—others will have similar experiences to mine—works in part with key words and in part with author’s names.
