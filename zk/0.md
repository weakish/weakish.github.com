There is always an assumed audience in writing.
Who is the audience when I write for thinking, [[0a]] a.k.a. taking notes?
Me myself.
However, it is unlikely that all these concepts and differences are encountered for the first time during the current writing session.
I have to revise old ones from my brain.
Therefore, writing is actually a communication between me and my past self.

But actually it is hard to fetch all those old ones in my brain.
Some of them I need to retrieve from my second brain, my previous notes, a.k.a. slip boxes.
Therefore, writing is a communication between me and slip boxes. (1:13)
And I expect my communication partner to be a competent one, one that can surprise [[0d]] me.
How can I achieve that?
I need a system optimized for search [[0c]] and write [[0e]] performance, with a stellordnung [[0b]] addressing scheme

There seems to be a typo in the the quote, "a competent partner o communication",
where "o" should be "of".
