> That slip boxes can be recommended as partners of communication is first of all due to a simple problem about technical and economic theoretical research. It is impossible to think without writing; at least it is impossible in any sophisticated or networked (anschlußfähig) fashion. Somehow we must mark differences, and capture distinctions which are either implicitly or explicitly contained in concepts. Only if we have secured in this way the constancy of the schema that produces information, can the consistency of the subsequent processes of processing information be guaranteed. And if one has to write anyway, it is useful to take advantage of this activity in order to create in the system of notes a competent partner o communication.

Sophisticated thinking is information processing involving multiple networked concepts.
And it is hard to keep all of these concepts, together with their differences in mind.
Therefore, writing is necessary.

There is always an assumed audience in writing.
Who is the audience when I write for thinking, a.k.a. taking notes?
Me myself.
However, it is unlikely that all these concepts and differences are encountered for the first time during the current writing session.
I have to revise old ones from my brain.
Therefore, writing is actually a communication between me and my past self.

But actually it is hard to fetch all those old ones in my brain.
Some of them I need to retrieve from my second brain, my previous notes, a.k.a. slip boxes.
Therefore, writing is a communication between me and slip boxes.
And I expect my communication partner to be a competent one.
How can I achieve that?
I need a system.

BTW, there seems to be a typo in the last sentence of the quote, "a competent partner o communication",
where "o" should be "of".
