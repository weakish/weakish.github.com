"It is impossible to think without writing", at least in "any sophisticated thinking", (1:14) where the information processing (1:16) involve multiple connectable (anschlußfähig) concepts. (1:14)
And it is hard to keep all of these concepts, together with their differences in mind. (1:16)

> ¹⁴It is impossible to think without writing; at least it is impossible in any sophisticated or networked (_anschlußfähig_) fashion. ¹⁵Somehow we must mark differences, and capture distinctions which are either implicitly or explicitly contained in concepts. ¹⁶Only if we have secured in this way the constancy of the schema that produces information, can the consistency of the subsequent processes of processing information be guaranteed.
