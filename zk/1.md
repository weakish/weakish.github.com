# How to (Not) Prepare for a Marathon

## Route

The modern standard marathon distance used in all Olympic games since 1924
was set by the IAAF in 1921
directly from the distance used in the 1908 London Olympics.
The organizer of 1908 London Olympics decided the course of 26 miles
from Windsor Castle to the royal entrance of the White City Stadium,
with an extra 586 yards 2 feet lap of the track,
finishing in front of the Royal Box.
Olympic marathon races before 1921 did not use a fixed distance, but were all around 25 miles,
roughly the distance from Marathon to Athens by the longer, flatter route
followed by the modern Marathon-Athens highway (EO83–EO54).

However, some suggested that Philippides might have run a shorter route of 22 miles with a more steep climb in the first 3 miles.

Be it 22 miles or 25 miles, the original marathon route in the historical legend is a trail route, not a road route.

## Dress

Most runners attending modern marathon dress in revealing [^1] sportswear [^2], while it was said that Pheidippides the Greek messenger discarded his weapons and even clothes to lose as much weight as possible. [^3]

[^1]: By traditional standards, e.g. the Islamic code of modesty.
[^2]: There are exceptions, e.g. María Lorena Ramírez Hernández competes in her long skirt.
[^3]: Pheidippides is depicted naked in Luc-Olivier Merson's 1869 painting.

## Time

Usually road marathons will cut off at 6 hours to reopen the roads,
which is much faster than the normal travel pace in DnD (3 miles per hour). [^5]
However, 6 hours cut off allows for finishing a half marathon in a normal DnD travel pace.

[^5]: Normal travel time is 24 miles per day, which is 8 hours of travel, 8 hours of rest, and 8 hours of downtime. This is roughly 3 miles per hour, a fast walk. At a cost of minus 5 passive perception, a DnD player can travel 30 miles a day, ([PHB][] p181) still not having enough time to finish a marathon within 6 hours.

## Training

Measuring intensity is crucial for training.
A simple way is to read a paragraph alound during a [talk test][].
For example, a paragraph from [Pheidippides][] by Robert Browning.

## Message

Pheidippides run to send a message *νικώ*. [^4]
That brings me to the question:
Do I have a message that I need or want to send which requires a marathon to deliver?
My answer is no.
Therefore, should I have started to prepare for a marathon in the first place,
just incase one day I might have a message to send?
I don't think so.
