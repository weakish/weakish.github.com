> ²⁷Since all papers have fixed numbers, you can add as many references to them as you may want. ²⁸Central concepts can have many links which show on which other contexts we can find materials relevant for them. ²⁹Through references, we can, without too work or paper, solve the problem of multiple storage. ³⁰Given this technique, it is less important where we place a new note. ³¹If there are several possibilities, we can solve the problem as we wish and just record the connection by a link [or reference].
