Linking, made possible by a unique and immutable number,
solves the problem of multiple storage, (2:29)
and also enriches the content of the notes,
since "every note is only an element which receives its quality only from the network of links and back-links within the system". (2:52)
Put it another way, an orphan slip is an ill one that "will get lost", (2:53)
whose "rediscovery depends on accidents" (2:54),
assuming that Zettelkasten is implemented in its original analog form,
without the help of full-text search in a digital system.

> ²⁷Since all papers have fixed numbers, you can add as many references to them as you may want. ²⁸Central concepts can have many links which show on which other contexts we can find materials relevant for them. ²⁹Through references, we can, without too work or paper, solve the problem of multiple storage. ³⁰Given this technique, it is less important where we place a new note. ³¹If there are several possibilities, we can solve the problem as we wish and just record the connection by a link [or reference].
