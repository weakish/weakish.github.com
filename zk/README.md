# My Zettelkasten Journal

I am trying to take notes of my understanding of the Zettelkasten note-taking system.
As a first step, I will try to take notes of the English translation of
[Communicating with Slip Boxes][Zettelkasten] by Niklas Luhmann.

[Zettelkasten]: https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes

Previously, my understanding of note-taking is noting down something for future reference.
Inspired by the concept of cheatsheets such as [tldr] and [devhints],
I will try to keep my notes short and concise.

[tldr]: https://tldr.sh
[devhints]: https://devhints.io

Gradually, I will try to apply what I learned from the Zettelkasten system to notes in this directory.
I will also use git to record this process.

In the end, I hope I can have a collection of notes representing my understanding of the Zettelkasten system,
implemented in a way similar to the Zettelkasten system itself.
