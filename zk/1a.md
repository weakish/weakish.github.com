A beginner runner can start from mile runs, 2 or 3 times per week.
Mile in mile run refers to an international mile (1609.344 m), but it does [not need to be accurate][distance].
A metric mile (1600 m), a nautical mile (1852 m), an Ottoman mile (1,894.35 m), or even an Irish mile and a Portuguese mile (roughly 2 km) make no difference here.
Actually the old English mile in the medieval and early modern periods varied over time and location within England, roughly between 1.5 km and 2.1 km.

If an international mile feels too short, a Welsh mile (6.17 km), a Breslau mile (6700 m), a Russian mile (7.468 km), a Danish mile (7.5 km), a Prussian mile (7.5325 km), or an Austrian mile (7.586 km) can be used instead.
Again, it does not need to be accurate.
Actually the common Dutch mile (varied from 5660 m to 7535 m), the Hungarian mile (varied from 8.3790 km to 8.9374 km before being standardised as 8.3536 km), or the Scandinavian mile (10 km since metrication in 1889) and Croatian mile (11.13 km) will be a good choice for a one hour easy run for beginners.
