<p>This site uses <a href="https://pagefind.app" title="Pagefind homepage">Pagefind</a>,
a static search library, to implement the search function via JavaScript.
</p>
<p>If your browser does not enable or support JavaScript,
please consider enable JavaScript for this page,
or switch to another browser to access this page.
</p>
<p>I am sorry for the inconvinience,
but implementing static site search without relying on external search engines requires JavaScript.
All other pages of this site do not use JavaScript.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can search this site via external search engines,
for example, <code>site:mmap.page keywords</code> on
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" title="DuckDuckGo search engine">DuckDuckGo</a>.
Some pages may not be indexed by search engines though.</p>
<p>You can also search the source code at <a href="https://github.com" title="source code repository">GitHub</a>.
Unfortunately, the search function on GitHub website also requires JavaScript.
But you can use their <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search" "GitHub search REST API">REST API</a> instead.</p>
<p>And of course, you can clone the source repository of this site,
and use any tool you preferred to serch it.</p>
