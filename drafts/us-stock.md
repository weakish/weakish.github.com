## My requirements for US stockbrokers

- Support Non-Resident Alien (NRA) Accounts.

    I am not a US resident.

- A [member of SIPC][sipc].

    > SIPC was created under the Securities Investor Protection Act as a non-profit membership corporation.
    > SIPC oversees the liquidation of member firms that close when the firm is bankrupt or in financial trouble, and customer assets are missing.
    > In a liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act, SIPC and the court-appointed Trustee work to return customersâ€™ securities and cash as quickly as possible.
    > Within limits, SIPC expedites the return of missing customer property by protecting each customer up to $500,000 for securities and cash (including a $250,000 limit for cash only).

- Offer fractional shares (stock slices).

    This feature is very friendly to a poor man such as me.
