## Tech Stack of This Site

### Services

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

    Unfortunately it dose not support IPv6.
    I am considering to switch to Netlify.

    Serving icons on the fly.
    Thus I can directly link to [Feather] icons, without messing around with npm and JavaScript.

    The HTML form at the page bottom allows visitors to search this site via site search at DuckDuckGo.

[Feather]: https://feathericons.com/

### Languages

Just HTML and CSS.
No JavaScript.

### Static Site Generator

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), just because GitHub Pages uses it.

## Hardware

- [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html)

    Compact. Inexpensive. Linux friendly.

- HP Z22n G2 Display

    Compact. Accurate color. 1920 x 1080 is sufficient for Linux.
    (I use a 4K display with a MacBook Pro at office.)

- [IKBC C87](https://www.ikbckeyboard.com/product-page/c87)

    * Wired: Bluetooth keyboards may have troubles when booting a full-disk encryption Linux.
    * 80%: Less space but all functional keys (F1-F12, arrow keys, etc) are available.
    * Cherry MX Brown: Cherry MX Switches are reliable. Actually I am fine with both brown and red switches.
    * PBT: Resist to oil, sweat, and lotion. More durable.
    * Steel board: I dislike this. It makes the keyboard heavier.
    * Not programmable: Less convenient but acceptable.

- [Razer DeathAdder Left-handed Edition](https://www.razer.com/eu-en/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-left-handed-edition)

    One of the few left-handed mouses available in my region.

## Software

- [i3](https://i3wm.org/)

    i3 is an active maintained tiling window manager with good documentation.

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/)

    Firefox also has a lot of issues.
    But other browsers suck more.

- [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)

    I use it to write TypeScript, JavaScript, Markdown, and Clojure.
    Visual Studio Code is non free.
    I use [VSCodium], a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution.

- [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

    One of the only two software subscriptions I have.
    I use it for Go, Java, Python and PHP.


- [Leafpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafpad)

    Simple.

- [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/)

    The default terminal emulator in KDE.
    Quite feature-rich.

- [Dolphin](https://kde.org/applications/en/system/org.kde.dolphin)

    Probably the most functional GUI file manager in Linux.
