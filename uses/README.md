# Uses

## Colophon

- Frontend: just HTML and CSS, 100% JavaScript free.
- Generator: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) since this site was hosted at GitHub Pages before.

## Hardware

- [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html)

    Compact. Inexpensive. Linux friendly.

- HP Z22n G2 Display

    Compact. Accurate color. 1920 x 1080 is sufficient for Linux.

- [IKBC C87](https://www.ikbckeyboard.com/product-page/c87)

    * Wired: Bluetooth keyboards may have troubles when booting a full-disk encryption Linux.
    * 80%: Less space but all functional keys (F1-F12, arrow keys, etc) are available.
    * Cherry MX Brown: Cherry MX Switches are reliable. Actually I am fine with both brown and red switches.
    * PBT: Resist to oil, sweat, and lotion. More durable.
    * Steel board: I dislike this. It makes the keyboard heavier.
    * Not programmable: Less convenient but acceptable.

- [Razer DeathAdder Left-handed Edition](https://www.razer.com/eu-en/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-left-handed-edition)

    One of the few left-handed mouses.

- [iPhone SE]

    A small portable phone.
    In fact, I prefer Android phones, but Google only provides three years of security updates for Pixel phones.
    For example, Pixel 4a will not receive any security updates after 2023.
    I also prefer the first generation of iPhone SE, which is lighter and smaller.
    However, the first generation uses the A9 chip which is vulnerable to [checkm8].
    Thus, I chose the second generation.

## Software

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

    Under WSL at office and Ubuntu at Home.

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/)

    Firefox sucks.
    But other browsers suck more.

- [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)

    With Neovim native LSP, GitHub Copilot, and LanguageTool,
    under Alacritty terminal emulator.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    I use VSCode for ReScript, since the official vim plugin is sitll based on coc.vim,
    and its language server is outdated compared to the one included in the VSCode extension.

- [Dolphin](https://kde.org/applications/en/system/org.kde.dolphin)

    Probably the most functional GUI file manager in Linux.

## Wear

All casual clothing, mostly H&M, Uniqlo, Decathlon, and Lululemon.
I have no formal, semiformal, or informal clothing,
thus usually ignore any dress code,
and never go to places enforcing a non-casual dress code.
I usually wear sneakers and prefer [vintage style running shoes][thedeffest], those [revised] [models] originated from [1960s], [1970s], and [1980s], [light and comfort][ad].
