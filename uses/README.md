# Uses

## Colophon

Made with [[Lume]].

I keep a local copy of the site source in my phone and browse them with [[Obsidian]].

## Computers

- `MacBookPro15,4`

    The last generation of Intel based MacBookPro.

    I use [MacPorts] as the package manager for command line programs and [Homebrew] for GUI applications.
    Previously I also use Homebrew for command line programs.
    The migration to MacPorts was very smooth.

    My previous personal Apple computer was the last generation of PowerPC based iBook (`PowerBook 6,7`).

- iPhone 13 mini

    Nowadays, there are almost no choices left for compact smart-phones.
    I bought iPhone 13 mini (131.5 x 64.2 x 7.65 mm, 141 g, 2406 mAH) in 2022, before iPhone SE 3rd generation (138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm, 144 g, 2018 mAH) is available in the Apple Store.
    I prefer Android phones, but [Balmuda Phone] (123 x 69 x 13.7 mm, 138 g, 2500 mAH) is discontinued and [Sony Xperia Ace III] (140 x 69 x 8.9 mm, 162 g, 4500 mAH) are only available in Japan,
    while Samsung Galaxy S23 (146.3 x 70.9 x 7.6 mm, 168 g, 3900 mAh), Sony Xperia 10 V (155 x 68 x 8.3 mm, 159 g, 5000 mAh), and Asus Zenfone 10 (146.5 x 68.1 x 9.4 mm, 172 g, 4300 mAh) are slightly bigger.
    Previously I used Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (129 x 65 x 9.3 mm, 140 g, 2700 mAH), then iPhone SE 2rd generation (138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm, 148 g, 1821 mAH).

- iPad 9th generation

    Among the iPads that Apple is still selling, the 9th generation iPad is the only one with a headphone jack,
    and the cheapest one can be used as a second display via sidecar with Mac.

## Editor

I mainly use VSCode since it is a popular choice for a lot of languages and frameworks.
Also, it has first class support for GitHub Copilot which I used a lot.
Currently I am on its Pro plan but GitHub does not bill me for it (`SKU: free_engaged_oss`).

Some of my friends are using [Cursor][] but I have not tried it yet.
I might try it and [Windsurf][] in future.

## Terminal

I use [kitty] because previously I had used Neovim for some time and kitty works well with Neovim (true color & undercurl).
Also, kitty is from Kovid Goyal, the author of [calibre].

## Browser

Safari is my main browser since it is the default one on macOS and iOS,
and it is said to be more power efficient than other alternatives.

Occasionally I use Chromium for fancy features such as [WebGPU].

Personally I prefer Firefox and Vivaldi but ironically I do not use them,
just like I prefer Linux and BSD but I do not use them.
I have not thought about this too much, maybe because I have low self-esteem and think I do not deserve the best.

## Online Services

- Transfer files: [WeTransfer] and [SwissTransfer]. No account is needed for both the sender and the receiver. The former has a 2GB limit, while the latter has a 50GB limit.

## Camera

- Olympus Pen D3

    Fully manual compact half-frame camera.
    I often load it with Fomapan Classical 100 or Eastman Double X.
    I prefer Orthochromatic films such as Rollei Ortho 25 Plus and Ilford Ortho Plus, but they are hard to buy.
    Sometimes I also use color films produced by Kodak or Fujifilm.
    I use Ilford HP5 Plus pushed two or three stops for low light.

## Wear

I used to prefer [vintage style running shoes][thedeffest], those revised [models] originated from [1960s] to [1980s], [light and comfort][ad].
However, I found out that their toe boxes are narrow.
Nowadays, I often wear a pair of Crocs Classical Clog instead, which has a large toe box.
I also put on some charms to make my white Crocs prettier.
Occasionally, I wear Vibram FiveFingers KSO ECO Green, which is extremely light and minimalistic.

## Drink

Water, milk, and Juice.
I seldom drink coffee or tea, and almost never drink alcohol.
However, I do like drinking chocolate.
