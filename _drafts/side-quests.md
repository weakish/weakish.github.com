- [ ] TypeScript slogans

    - The current one is "TypeScript is just JavaScript with types."

        I just cannot help to think that:

            - TypeScript is just JavaScript with unsound types.

            - Python 3 is just Python with types.

        I remembered their previous slogan is something like "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript." (targeted at CoffeeScrit and Dart). Then "TypeScript is JavaScript that scales." (only targeted at big projects.) Now they seemingly want to attract all JavaScript deverlopers.
