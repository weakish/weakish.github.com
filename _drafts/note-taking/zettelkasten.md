## Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method

https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/

That brings us back to our short definition:

> ==A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create ==a web of thoughts== instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and ==emphasize connection, not a collection==.

> [!note] typo: s/a web of thought/a web of thoughts/

There are several ways to identify notes, the most common are:

1. There is of course the **Luhmann-ID**. You create some kind of arbitrary hierarchy wherein each Zettel has a place where it could be. Using a paper-based Zettelkasten, I recommend using this technique because it helps to deal with its organisation. The other types of ID wouldn’t work as well for paper.

Also, Luhmann had [hub notes](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-hubs/). These are Zettels that ==list many other places to look at for a continuation of a topic==.

## Introducing the Antinet Zettelkasten

https://zettelkasten.de/posts/introduction-antinet-zettelkasten/

The ==four principles== Niklas Luhmann used to build his notebox system are:

1. ==Analog==
2. ==Numeric-alpha==
3. ==Tree==
4. ==Index==

The ==first letters of those four principles (A, N, T, I) are what comprise an Antinet==. An Antinet Zettelkasten is a network of these four principles.

### Analog

Luhmann did not specify analog as a requirement over digital. The reason why is simple. ==Digital tools were not an option when he started building his Zettelkasten.==

### Notecard Address

This enables what Luhmann phrased as ==“the possibility of linking.”==

It’s merely ==the location of where the leaf lives on a branch or stem on your tree of knowledge. Think of it more like a geographic coordinate system==, like a latitude and longitude scheme (for instance, -77.0364,38.8951).

The Numeric-alpha addresses never change; however, ==due to the infinite internal branching of the system, its position shifts over time==.

### Tree

The third principle is based on something Luhmann refers to as ==“the possibility of arbitrary internal branching.”==

One researcher who studied Luhmann’s system in person says, “==at first glance, Luhmann’s organization of his collection appears to lack any clear order; it even seems chaotic==. However, this was a deliberate choice.”

Think of a Zettelkasten as a tree. A real tree. What does a real tree contain? It contains a trunk, branches, stems, leaves, and vines (depending on the tree). ==Think of each individual leaf as a notecard.== With a Zettelkasten, you’ll be building a tree of knowledge. One that has different branches, different stems of thought, and even ==vines that link to other branches==. This allows one to explore and swing between branches, stems, and leaves.

### Index

==Luhmann calls this concept a “Register.”==

### The Net in Antinet

The Antinet, according to Luhmann, was ==self-referential== in nature. It was self-referential because of its ability to reference itself via the ==numeric-alpha addresses==.

When the four principles are combined into a system, the Antinet becomes a ==thinking tool==, a ==communication partner==, and a ==second mind==. They combine to create many other novel phenomena, such as ==insightful surprises by way of ordered randomness==.



## A Paper Zettelkasten System for Nonfiction Writers

==Digital for reference==? Yes, please.

> [!note] That's what I understand notes used for. For reference as cheatsheets.

Digital for note-making? ==I just don’t enjoy spending my off-the-clock time staring into a screen==. I realized I was violating my own law! (**Havron’s First Law of Personal Information Management: ==Use tools you love to use.==**)

> [!note] That's why I use an analog camera.

I ==paper and pens==. I will ==happily noodle around with index cards== early in the morning, and long into the night. And thinking is partly noodling around — looking at notes, seeing something you can add, finding connections.

Simple and clear was what I found with a book called How to Make Notes and Write, by Dan Allosso and S. F. Allosso.

He ==does not parse out four or five fine-grained types of notes (fleeting, literature, evergreen, sprout, etc)==.

==He uses two: source notes, and point notes.== ==“Source Notes” are notes he makes mostly from the source but with some initial thoughts and questions.== “Point Notes” are his own thoughts:

“Others have called these ==“Main Notes” or “Permanent Notes” or “Evergreen Notes”==. I called them ==Point Notes== to remind myself that when I write them I should be ==making a point==.” (Allosso 2022, p 66)

My ==hybrid solution== consists of ==two text files==, one to ==list Sources==, and a =="Card List" to list main cards as Einsteigspunkte (entry points) to the slip box==.

My slip box contains ==4x6== index cards with ==only two note types: Source Notes and Main Notes==.

I give ==each source a four digit ID==:
0230 Ready for Anything/Allen; kindle
0231 Getting Things Done/Allen; kindle
0232 Long Psychology of Education; concept schema exemplars

I number source notes with the Source ID, e.g. 0232-4, etc.

My ==Card List contains mostly top-level cards, and sometimes child cards (further on the branch) only if they contain a keyword of interest== (i.e. a place I would want to enter a thread). I use ==Luhmann's alphanumeric numbering for the main cards==.

The ==Card List effectively also serves as a keyword index as I will add keywords to a card title==.

I like that I can leverage digital to search quickly for a source or card location, but keep the fun of taking and making notes on paper.
