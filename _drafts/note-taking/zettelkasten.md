My ==hybrid solution== consists of ==two text files==, one to ==list Sources==, and a =="Card List" to list main cards as Einsteigspunkte (entry points) to the slip box==.

My slip box contains ==4x6== index cards with ==only two note types: Source Notes and Main Notes==.

I give ==each source a four digit ID==:
0230 Ready for Anything/Allen; kindle
0231 Getting Things Done/Allen; kindle
0232 Long Psychology of Education; concept schema exemplars

I number source notes with the Source ID, e.g. 0232-4, etc.

My ==Card List contains mostly top-level cards, and sometimes child cards (further on the branch) only if they contain a keyword of interest== (i.e. a place I would want to enter a thread). I use ==Luhmann's alphanumeric numbering for the main cards==.

The ==Card List effectively also serves as a keyword index as I will add keywords to a card title==.

I like that I can leverage digital to search quickly for a source or card location, but keep the fun of taking and making notes on paper.
