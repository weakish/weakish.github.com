# Dog Bites Treatment

The main principles recommended by [WHO] are:

- early medical management;

- irrigation and cleansing of the wound;

- primary closure if the wound is low-risk for developing infection;

- prophylactic antibiotics for high-risk wounds or people with immune deficiency;

- rabies post-exposure treatment depending on the dog vaccination status;

- administration of tetanus vaccine if the person has not been adequately vaccinated.

[WHO]: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/animal-bites

## Irrigation and Cleansing

This is to reduce the risk of infection.


> Irrigation is particularly important if the dog is suspected of being rabid. Gentle debridement after irrigation is essential as irrigation alone may not remove the virus from wound edges; the wound should then be covered with a sterile dressing or a clean dry cloth.
>
> Thorough cleansing significantly lessens the risk of rabies. Hence flushing the wound under a running tap for several minutes, washing with soapy water or detergent, and particularly using wound disinfectants (such as 40-70% alcohol, tincture, or aqueous solution of povidone-iodine) is recommended. ([Morgan] 2007)

### High-Pressure Irrigation

> Some evidence suggests high-pressure irrigation may reduce bacterial counts more effectively than simple irrigation, although other recommendations suggest avoidance of high-pressure irrigation because of concern that infectious agents will be driven into deeper tissue locations. ([Meissner][AAP] 2019)


## Primary Closure

WHO words this as "if the wound is low-risk for developing infection",
because this is controversial.

> The role of wound closure remains controversial.([Am Fam Physician][aafp]. 2001;63(8):1567-1573)

> primary suturing should be avoided if possible ([Morgan] 2007)

> Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that primary closure is not routinely indicated following a dog bite, except for bites to the face (Clin Infect Dis. 2014;59:e10-52).
>
> Primary closure may increase the risk of infection, even when prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is administered. ([Meissner][AAP] 2019)

> It remains controversial whether primary closure poses a slightly increased risk of infection, but most randomized clinical trials have concluded that infection rates for primary and secondary closures are equivalent at 40%.
> All studies comparing modalities of treatment have demonstrated that primary closure yields faster healing and superior cosmetic outcomes, as quantified by reduced scar size and appearance. ([Savu] et al 2021)

## Prophylactic Antibiotics

WHO listed two conditions for prophylactic antibiotics:

1. people with immune deficiency
2. high-risk wounds

The first one is consistent with guidelines from other sources:

> All immunocompromised children are candidates for post-exposure prophylaxis following a dog bite. ([AAP] 2019)

The second one is controversial.

It is a common practice to indicate prophylactic antibiotics routinely:

> Treatment with prophylactic antibiotics for three to seven days is appropriate for dog bite wounds, unless the risk of infection is low or the wound is superficial. ([Am Fam Physician][aafp]. 2001;63(8):1567-1573)

> In actual practice in the US, most dog bites get antibiotics, regardless of location. ([Med Mal Reviewer] 2023)

But as [Savu] et al (2021) pointed at:

> Prophylactic antibiotic treatment of dog bite wounds remains controversial

So more researchers (*not physicians*) prefer the middle way:

> Some authors advise empirical prophylaxis for all animal bites,
> while others take a more sensible approach, restricting prophylaxis to injuries or patients deemed at high risk of infection. ([Morgan] 2007)

Basically, "high-risk wounds" in WHO principles refer to deeper wounds or wounds in sites where infection is more likely to occur,
as [Meissner][AAP] (2019) summarized:

> Antibiotic prophylaxis commonly is recommended for moderate to severe wounds of the face, hands (bites tend to involve the dominant hand), feet or genital area. Bites involving tendon, bone or joints and bites resulting in devitalized tissue generally are treated with antibiotic prophylaxis.

As mentioned before, primary closure may increase the risk of infection,
so [Tabaka] et al (2015) recommended prophylactic antibiotics under this situation:

> Puncture wounds or wounds closed during treatment are dog bite wounds at a high risk of infection and should be considered for treatment with prophylactic antibiotics.

The first choice of prophylactic antibiotics is co-amoxiclav, ([Meissner][AAP] 2019)
although "no strong evidence base supports the routine use of co-amoxiclav" ([Morgan] 2007).

## Tetanus

WHO's wording "has not been adequately vaccinated" is not detailed.
[Meissner][AAP] (2019) recommends tetanus vaccination for

> dirty wounds if more than five years has elapsed since the last dose;
>
> clean wounds if more than 10 years.

## Rabies

If not previously vaccinated:

> HDCV, RVA, or PCEC 1 mL, IM (deltoid area†), once daily on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 ([Am Fam Physician][aafp]. 2001;63(8):1567-1573)

## Follow-up

> Most bite wounds should be reexamined in 24 to 48 hours, especially bites to the hands. ([Am Fam Physician][aafp]. 2001;63(8):1567-1573)

> Review bites within 24-48 hours, especially if the bites need antimicrobial prophylaxis ([Morgan] 2007)

#### Notes

[Terramycin] Oph Oint, a.k.a.
Terramycin (Oxytetracycline Hydrochloride and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Ointment)
is an antibiotic typically used for eye infection.
It is discontinued by FDA due to toxicity issues. ([Mohapatra] et al 2021)

### Day 1

Terramycin applied once before bedtime.

### Day 2

Terramycin applied once before bedtime.

### Day 3

Second dose of the rabies vaccine.

> Rabies Verorab (TRCS) VACCINE (0.5 mL) Vial R

Another physician indicates that Terramycin should be applied twice daily, after breakfast and dinner,
and also gives co-amoxiclav for 5 days.

It seems that this physician tends to give more antibiotics treatments.
Since the specialty of the first physician is "Emergency Medicine"
and specialty of the second physician is surgery,
it is likely the first physician is more experienced in treating dog bites.
Therefore, the first physician's treatment was followed:
Terramycin was applied once daily before bedtime instead of twice daily,
and co-amoxiclav was not taken.

Both physicians are from JCI-accredited hospitals.

### More

Tetanus vaccines and Verorab rabies vaccines were given as scheduled.
