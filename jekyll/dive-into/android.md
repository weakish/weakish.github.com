# Android Setup Guide

## No Google Account

I do not sign in to a Google Account on the phone, because I dislike the idea of link a device to an online account.

Without a Google Account, I cannot install applications via Google Play Store.
Thus I use [F-Droid] (free and open source) and [APKPure] (apk files identical to those in the Google Play Store) to install applications.

[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/
[APKPure]: https://apkpure.com/

## Applications

- Application market: F-Droid
- Browser: [DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser] and [Vivaldi]
with user activity tracking disabled by default)
- Note taking: [Simple Notes]
- VPN: Wireguard

[Vivaldi]: https://vivaldi.com/android/

I also use some preinstalled applications, for example, calculator and Google Photos (with backup & sync turned off since I do not sign in to a Google Account).
